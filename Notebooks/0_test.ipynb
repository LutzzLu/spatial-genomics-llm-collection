Tumour ecosystems feature\\ndiverse immune cell types. Myeloid cells, in particular, are prevalent and have a\\nwell-established role in promoting the disease. In our study, we proï¬le\\napproximately 900,000 cells from 25 treatment-naive patients with adeno-\\ncarcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma by single-cell and spatial tran-\\nscriptomics. We note an inverse relationship between anti-inï¬ammatory\\nmacrophages and NK cells/T cells, and with reduced NK cell cytotoxicity within\\nthe tumour. While we observe a similar cell type composition in both adeno-\\ncarcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma, we detect signiï¬cant differences\\nin the co-expression of various immune checkpoint inhibitors. Moreover, we\\nreveal evidence of a transcriptional âreprogrammingâ of macrophages in\\ntumours, shifting them towards cholesterol export and adopting a foetal-like\\ntranscriptional signature which promotes iron efï¬ux. Our multi-omic resource\\noffers a high-resolution molecular map of tumour-associated macrophages,\\nenhancing our understanding of their role within the tumour\\nmicroenvironment.\\nLung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the\\nï¬rst cause of cancer death worldwide1, with a 5-year survival of ~6% in\\npatients with the most advanced stages2. Non-small-cell lung cancer\\n(NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer (~85% of total cases),\\nfollowed by small-cell lung cancer (15% of total cases)3. Lung cancer is a\\ncomplex disease in which the tumour microenvironment plays a cri-\\ntical role and macrophages (MÉ¸) are intimately involved in the pro-\\ngression of the disease. In particular, tumour-associated MÉ¸ (TAMs)\\ncan exhibit a dual role, contributing to tumour promotion by\\nsuppressing the immune response, facilitating angiogenesis, and aid-\\ning in tissue remodelling, but also tumour suppression by promoting\\ninï¬ammation and engaging in cytotoxic activity against cancer cells4,5.\\nThe intricate interplay between lung cancer and MÉ¸ highlights the\\nimportance of understanding their dynamic relationship in order to\\ndevelop more effective therapeutic strategies.\\nWithin NSCLC, adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common\\nhistological subtype, followed by squamous-cell carcinoma (LUSC).\\nLobectomy (i.e., the anatomical resection of a lung lobe) is currently\\nReceived: 2 November 2023\\nAccepted: 8 May 2024\\nCheck for updates\\n1Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, UK. 2OpenTargets, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, UK. 3Department of Haema-\\ntology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. 4Wellcome TrustâMedical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, UK. 5European\\nMolecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute EMBL-EBI, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, UK. 6Division of Artiï¬cial Intelligence in\\nOncology, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany. 7Precision Medicine and Computational Biology, Sanoï¬, Cambridge, MA, USA. 8Precision Medicine and Computa-\\ntional Biology, Sanoï¬, Paris, France. 9Medical Image and Signal Processing Laboratory (MEDISP), Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of West\\nAttica, Athens, Greece. 10Biotech Research & Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. 11These authors contributed\\nequally: Marco De Zuani, Haoliang Xue.\\ne-mail: ana.cvejic@bric.ku.dk\\nNature Communications|   (2024) 15:4388 \\n1\\n1234567890():,;\\n1234567890():,;\\nthe gold standard for the treatment of early stages of NSCLC (stage I/\\nII), while patients with unresectable stage III or metastatic stage IV\\nNSCLC are treated with a combination of chemotherapy and neoad-\\njuvant targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or immune\\ncheckpoint inhibitors (ICIs) like PD1, PDL1 and CTLA4. Advancements\\nmade in the last decade in uncovering predictive biomarkers have\\npaved the way for novel therapeutic prospects in the ï¬elds of targeted\\ntherapy and immunotherapy on the basis of tumour histology and\\nPDL1 expression6.\\nA number of studies have employed single-cell technologies to\\nexplore transcriptional changes in NSCLC7â9. They have extensively\\nexamined the lung tumour microenvironment revealing diverse T-cell\\nfunctions linked to patient prognosis, relevance of diversity of B cells\\nin NSCLC for anti-tumour therapy, multiple states of tumour-\\ninï¬ltrating myeloid cells, proposing them as a new target in immu-\\nnotherapy, as well as the association of tissue-resident neutrophils\\nwith anti-PDL1 therapy failure7,10â14. They further unveiled tumour\\nheterogeneity and cellular changes in advanced and metastatic\\ntumours8,9 as well as tumour therapy-induced transition of cancer cells\\nto a primitive cell state15. In many of these studies, a limited number of\\ncells was analysed per patient, and often there was no systematic\\ncollection of patient-matched non-tumour tissue, thus restricting dis-\\nsection of the biological heterogeneity within tumour and adjacent\\nnon-tumour tissue. Additionally, with some exceptions9,14, LUAD and\\nLUSC were considered as a single entity thus hindering the investiga-\\ntion of speciï¬c hallmarks of the two cancer types which are radically\\ndistinct both at the molecular and pathological level. While single-cell\\nRNA-seq (scRNA-seq) can identify cell types and their states at high\\nresolution within tissues, it lacks the capability to pinpoint their spatial\\ndistribution or capture the local cellâcell interactions as well as ligands\\nand receptors that mediate these interactions. Therefore, impeding\\nour ability to fully explore the tumour microenvironment (TME) and\\nthe complexity of cellâcell interactions therein.\\nTo overcome above mentioned limitations, we combined scRNA-\\nseq data from nearly 900,000 cells from 25 treatment-naive patients\\nwith LUAD or LUSC and spatial transcriptomics from eight patients to\\ninvestigate the differences in cellular organisation in tumour and\\nadjacent non-tumour tissue. We further examined MÉ¸ populations and\\nmolecular changes they undergo in the tumour environment, some of\\nwhich\\nresemble\\nthose\\nobserved\\nin\\nMÉ¸\\nduring\\nhuman\\nfoetal\\ndevelopment.\\nResults\\nScRNA-seq and spatial atlas of NSCLC samples\\nTo determine the heterogeneity of immune and non-immune cellular\\nstates and their spatial landscape in LUAD and LUSC, we collected lung\\ntissue resections from 25 treatment-naive patients with either LUAD\\n(n = 13), LUSC (n = 8) or undetermined lung cancer (LC, n = 4), and two\\nhealthy deceased donors (Fig. 1A, B and Supplementary Data 1). We\\ncollected both tumour and matched normal non-tumorigenic tissue\\n(i.e., background), isolated CD45+ immune cells (Supplementary\\nFig. 1A) as well as tumour and other non-immune populations (using\\nCD235a column to deplete erythroid cells), and performed scRNA-seq.\\nIn addition, tumour and background tissue sections from eight\\npatients (of the aforementioned 25) were processed for spatial tran-\\nscriptomics using the 10x Genomics Visium platform (n = 36 sections\\nin total) (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Data 1).\\nTumours exhibit a higher diversity of immune and non-immune\\ncells compared to adjacent lung tissue\\nFollowing quality control (QC) on the scRNA-seq dataset, we identiï¬ed\\n895,806 high-quality cells in total, of which 503,549 were from\\ntumour and 392,257 from combined background and healthy tissue\\n(from here on referred to as B/H). After performing normalisation and\\nlog1p transformation, highly-variable gene selection, dimensionality\\nreduction, batch correction, and Leiden clustering, cells originating\\nfrom tumour and B/H were separately annotated into distinct broad\\ncell types and visualised via Uniform Manifold Approximation and\\nProjection (UMAP) (Fig. 1C, Supplementary Fig. 1B, C, and âMethodsâ).\\nWe identiï¬ed clusters of myeloid cells with transcriptional signatures\\nof monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), as well as mast cells,\\nnatural killer (NK) cells, T cells, B cells and non-immune cells\\n(Fig. 1C, D). We did not detect neutrophilic granulocytes, most prob-\\nably due to their sensitivity to degradation after collection and in\\nparticular to the freezing-thawing cycle. Finally, we identiï¬ed a cluster\\ncharacterised by the co-expression of myeloid (LYZ, CD68, CD14, MRC1)\\nand epithelial genes (KRT19, EPCAM) (Fig. 1DâF). These cells were\\nfound within the tumour and exhibited similarities to previously\\ndescribed\\ncancer-associated\\nmacrophage-like\\ncells\\n(CAMLs)16â18.\\nCAMLs represent a distinct population of large myeloid cells with\\nconcomitant epithelial tumour protein expression19. These unique\\ncells have been observed in blood samples of patients with various\\nmalignancies, including NSCLC20. The abundance of CAMLs exhibits a\\ndirect correlation with response to therapeutic interventions, high-\\nlighting their functional signiï¬cance21. Even after further subclustering,\\nCAMLs maintained their distinct dual myeloid-epithelial signature\\n(Supplementary Fig. 1D). It is noteworthy that doublet detection soft-\\nware Scrublet assigned a low doublet score to CAMLs, suggesting their\\nexpression proï¬le is unlikely to be explained as a combined signature\\narising from the coincidental sequencing of a tumour cell and a mac-\\nrophage (Supplementary Fig. 1E). All clusters included cells from\\nmultiple patients, with the cluster size ranging from 2520 to 124,459\\ncells\\n(Supplementary\\nFig.\\n1F,\\nG).\\nFurthermore,\\nwe\\nconducted\\nreference-query mapping using scArches22 to conï¬rm the consistency\\nof our annotations in the tumour and B/H dataset (Supplementary\\nFig. 2AâC and Supplementary Notes).\\nThe composition of the immune and non-immune compartment\\nwas markedly different between the tumour and background. In the\\ntumour, we detected ï¬broblasts and a decrease in the fraction of\\nlymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) (Padj = 0.0025, Fig. 1G and Supple-\\nmentary Data 2). Furthermore, the population of epithelial cells\\nshowed higher diversity, with the presence of alveolar type II (AT2),\\natypical epithelial cells which downregulated epithelial markers\\n(KRT19, EPCAM, CDH1), transitioning epithelial cells which upregulated\\nmyeloid markers (LYZ), and cycling epithelial cells in tumour tissues\\n(Fig. 1G, Supplementary Notes, and Supplementary Fig. 2D, E). These\\ndifferences are in agreement with the fact that in tumour specimens,\\nepithelial cells are likely to be a mixture of mutant tumour and non-\\nmutant normal cells, and suggest that neoplastic transformation leads\\nto further diversity of cell states. We did not detect alveolar type I (AT1)\\nor basal cells, possibly due to their loss during dissociations, as pre-\\nviously reported by others8.\\nAs previously reported, the proportion of monocytes and imma-\\nture myeloid cells was signiï¬cantly reduced in tumour samples com-\\npared to background (Padj = 0.022 and Padj = 0.00001, respectively)7,\\nwhile DCs and B cells were overall expanded7 (Padj = 0.0023 and\\nPadj = 0.0044, respectively; Fig. 1H and Supplementary Data 3). To get\\nfurther insight into the cellular composition of tumour versus back-\\nground tissue, we subclustered each of the broad clusters and identiï¬ed\\n46 cell types/states (Supplementary Fig. 2D, E, Supplementary\\nData 4 and 5, Supplementary Fig. 3, and Supplementary Notes). In the\\ntumour, we found that a signiï¬cantly higher proportion of NK cells had\\na lower cytotoxicity phenotype (Supplementary Notes), and that the\\nsigniï¬cant majority of DCs were derived from monocytes (i.e., mo-DC2),\\n(Supplementary Notes) compared to background (Padj = 0.00002 and\\nPadj = 0.00002, respectively, Fig. 1I and Supplementary Data 6). This is\\nconsistent with the monocytic origin of mo-DC2s under inï¬ammatory\\nconditions23. Similarly, we found an expansion of B cells expressing LYZ\\nand TNF, and depletion of NKB cells (Fig. 1I and Supplementary Notes).\\nAmong T cells, tumour samples showed an accumulation of regulatory\\nArticle\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48700-8\\nNature Communications|   (2024) 15:4388 \\n2\\nT cells (Tregs), known to hinder the immune surveillance of tumours24\\n(Fig. 1I). Conversely, there was a reduction of exhausted cytotoxic T cells\\n(Padj = 0.00002) in the tumour and absence of Î³Î´ T cells, which have\\nbeen associated with survival in NSCLC25 (Fig. 1I and Supplementary\\nData 6). Î³Î´ T cells are capable of recognising and lysing diverse ranges\\nof cancer cells, and thus have been suggested for a role in pan-cancer\\nimmunotherapy26. Finally, we saw an increase in heterogeneity and\\nproportion of anti-inï¬ammatory MÉ¸ (AIMÉ¸), with a subset of cycling\\nanti-inï¬ammatory MÉ¸, STAB1 + MÉ¸ (Fig. 1I) and CAMLs (Fig. 1H) being\\nabundantly present in tumour tissue.

Therefore, we examined whether different cellâcell\\ninteraction networks were employed within the TME in LUAD versus\\nLUSC. To this end, we identiï¬ed a putative list of cellâcell interactions\\nexclusively observed in each tumour type environment by inferring\\nstatistically signiï¬cant ligandâreceptor pairs (LâRs) that were not\\ndetected in background or healthy and their corresponding cell types,\\nusing CellPhoneDB29. Although the two tumour subtypes showed a\\nsimilar interaction network that mostly involved interactions between\\nnon-immune cells, AIMÉ¸ and T cells (Fig. 2B), there were also some\\nnotable differences.\\nFirst, we identiï¬ed overall a higher number of LâRs in the LUAD\\ndataset (Supplementary Fig. 4D and Supplementary Data 9â12), which\\nwas not driven by a difference in the number of cells in the LUAD\\n(n = 105,749 cells) vs LUSC (n = 230,066 cells) dataset. Secondly, sev-\\neral pairs of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and their respective\\ninhibitory molecules were differentially co-expressed in LUAD versus\\nLUSC (Fig. 2C, D). For example, LGALS9-HAVCR2 (TIM3), NECTIN2-\\nCD226 (DNAM1) and NECTIN2/NECTIN3-TIGIT were frequently identiï¬ed\\nin LUAD, and the putative ICI CD96-NECTIN1 was found preferentially in\\nLUSC (Fig. 2C, D). In contrast, CD80/CD86-CTLA4 and HLAF-LILRB1/2\\nwere found in both tumour subtypes (Fig. 2C, D). LILRBs (leucocyte Ig-\\nlike receptors) are emerging as potential targets for next-generation\\nimmunotherapeutics as their blocking\\ncan\\npotentiate\\nimmune\\nresponses30. The most commonly used immunotherapies for lung\\ncancer block the interaction between PD1 and PDL1, and recent clinical\\ntrials suggested that anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 combination therapy\\nimproved the survival of patients independent of tumour PD1\\nexpression31,32. Within our dataset, we did not observe PD1-PDL1\\ninteractions in either of the tumour subtypes (Fig. 2C, D). Our initial\\nanalysis suggests that other ICIs (such as CTLA4, TIGIT, LILRB1/2 and\\nTIM3) might be promising targets in the treatment of NSCLC.\\nOf the signiï¬cant LâRs detected in both LUAD and LUSC we noted\\nseveral pairs involved in angiogenic signalling in different populations\\nof myeloid cells such as VEGFA/B-FLT1, VEGFA-KDR and VEGFA-NRP1/2.\\nAlthough VEGFA and VEGFB were found to be expressed in both LUAD\\nand LUSC, their receptors were more frequently found in LUAD,\\nespecially in ï¬broblasts (Fig. 2E and Supplementary Fig. 4E). Similarly,\\nwe observed signiï¬cant expression of EGFR ligands signalling in AT2\\nand cycling epithelial cells, such as EGFR-EREG, EGFR-AREG, EGFR-\\nHBEGF and EGFR-MIF, although MIF expression was found more fre-\\nquently in cells from LUSC (Fig. 2F and Supplementary Fig. 4F). Finally,\\nwe observed key co-stimulatory signals required to support lymphoid\\ncell activation, such as CD40-CD40LG, CD2-CD58, CD28-CD86, CCL21-\\nCCR7, and TNFRSF13B/C-TNFSF13B (TACI/BAFFR-BAFF) (Supplementary\\nFig. 4G), which are often associated with the presence of ectopic\\nlymphoid organs mainly consisting of B cells, T cells, and DCs i.e.,\\ntertiary lymphoid structures (TLS). TLS are usually correlated with the\\nlonger relapse-free survival in NSCLC33.\\nIntegration of scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics validates\\nLâR interactions in situ\\nThe signiï¬cant LâRs and their interacting cell types were calculated\\nbased on the co-expression of genes in different cell-type clusters from\\nthe scRNA-seq dataset using CellPhoneDB. However, in order to dis-\\ncern biologically signiï¬cant interactions, it is essential to ascertain\\nwhether the cell types identiï¬ed as interacting are indeed physically\\nco-located. To achieve this, we considered how the scRNA-seq-\\nidentiï¬ed cell types are spatially arranged on tissue sections. We\\napplied an integrative approach which combines the scRNA-seq of the\\ntumour and background samples with the spatial transcriptomic (STx)\\nproï¬le of the fresh frozen tumour and background tissue sections. We\\nperformed 10Ã Visium on two consecutive, 10-Âµm sections, from eight\\npatients, seven of which matched the samples used for the scRNA-seq.\\nWe analysed 36 sections in total (ntumour = 20, nbackground = 16) with an\\naverage UMI count of 6894/spot in tumour and 3350/spot in the\\nbackground. Next, we used cell2location34 and cell-type speciï¬c\\nexpression proï¬les from our scRNA-seq dataset to deconvolute cell-\\ntype abundances on the tissue (Fig. 3A, see âMethodsâ).\\nOnce the cell types were resolved on the tissue sections, we\\nexamined the frequency of different cell types across all sections from\\ntumour and background tissue. The cell-type abundance in tumour\\nand background were computed by summing up the posterior 5%\\nquantile (q05) value of estimated cell abundance by cell2location,\\nacross spots that passed QC (âMethodsâ). Our analysis conï¬rmed that\\nthe differences in the frequency of cell types across all sections\\nin tumour versus background was in line with the results obtained\\nin the scRNA-seq data (Fig. 3B). For example, in tumours we found\\nan\\nincrease\\nin\\nthe\\nproportion\\nof\\nB\\ncells\\n(Padj = 0.0372)\\nand\\ncycling AT2 cells (Padj = 0.0147) compared to the background tissue,\\nand a decrease in the proportion of immature cells (Padj = 0.0012), NK\\ncells\\n(Padj = 0.0012),\\nand\\nLECs\\n(Padj = 0.00077,\\nSupplementary\\nData 13 and 14). However, the proportions of other cell types estimated\\nfrom the scRNA-seq data or the STx data within the tumour or back-\\nground showed some discrepancies (Supplementary Fig. 4H, I). This\\nwas particularly evident within the non-immune populations, where\\nSTx estimated higher proportions of LECs, activated adventitial\\nï¬broblasts and cycling subsets, compared to scRNA-seq. Disparities in\\ncell proportions between different methodologies were previously\\nshown by others35,36, underscoring the potential inï¬uence of distinct\\nsampling biases inherent to scRNA-seq and STx techniques like Visium.\\nIn the case of scRNA-seq, variations in cell digestion sensitivity can lead\\nto differential representation of cell types. Meanwhile, with Visium,\\ndiscrepancies might arise from variations in the location of tumour\\nresections as well as differences in sample sizes compared to scRNA-\\nseq studies. Nevertheless, the overall concordance in the results\\nobtained by scRNA-seq and Visium suggests that our spatial âmapâ of\\ndifferent cell types faithfully represents their distribution in the tissue.\\nNext, we examined the spatial co-localisation of the LâRs identi-\\nï¬ed by cellphoneDB. The LâRs were considered to co-localise if both\\ngenes were expressed in the same spot and above median value for the\\ngiven genes across the section spots. We then compared the frequency\\nof spots in which LâR genes were colocalising versus non-colocalising\\nin the matched tumour versus background sections, using a Ï2 test\\n(âMethodsâ). Due to the low number of tissue blocks collected from\\nLUSC and LUAD patients (NLUSC = 3, NLUAD = 5), the statistical power\\nwas not sufï¬cient to perform a comparative analysis between spatial\\nlocalisation of LUAD/LUSC-speciï¬c LâRs. Nevertheless, we conï¬rmed\\nthat several of the aforementioned tumour-speciï¬c LâRs colocalized\\nsigniï¬cantly more in tumour than in background sections, including\\nNRP1-VEGFA and the ICIs NECTIN2-TIGIT, LGALS9-HAVCR2, and CD96-\\nNECTIN1 (Fig. 3CâE and Supplementary Data 15). Consistent with the\\ncellphoneDB results, we found no signiï¬cant colocalization of PD1-\\nPDL1 in the tumour sections.\\nCAMLs share similar copy number aberrations (CNAs) with\\ntumour cells\\nTumour samples obtained from surgical resection contain both\\nmalignant and residual normal epithelial cells. A signiï¬cant challenge\\nin scRNA-seq of human tumours lies in the differentiation of cancer\\ncells from non-malignant counterparts. Therefore, we applied Copy-\\nnumber Karyotyping of Tumors (CopyKAT37) to discern genome-wide\\naneuploidy within individual cells. The principle driving the compu-\\ntation of DNA copy number events from scRNA-seq data is rooted\\nin the notion that the expression levels of neighbouring genes\\ncan provide valuable information to infer genomic copy numbers\\nwithin that speciï¬c genomic segment. Since aneuploidy is common in\\nhuman cancers, cells with genome-wide CNAs are considered as\\ntumour cells.\\nAnalysis using CopyKAT revealed extensive, patient-speciï¬c CNAs\\nin tumour tissue (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. 5A) but not in the\\nArticle\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48700-8\\nNature Communications|   (2024) 15:4388 \\n5\\nbackground. Within individual tumour samples, the CNAs were\\ndetected in AT2 and cycling AT2 cells, and in some patients these\\ngenetic alterations were shared between AT2/cycling AT2 cells and\\natypical epithelial cells, suggesting a close lineage relationship\\nbetween different epithelial subpopulations (Fig. 4A and Supplemen-\\ntary Fig. 5A). We conï¬rmed this ï¬nding by inferring the trajectory of\\nnon-blood cell populations in tumour using Partition-Based Graph\\nAbstraction\\n(PAGA)38.\\nPAGA\\nshowed\\ndifferentiation\\ncontinuity\\nbetween AT2 cells, cycling AT2/epithelial cells, and atypical epithelial\\ncells on one side and ciliated epithelial cells and transitioning epithelial\\ncells on the other (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, blinded histological evalua-\\ntion conï¬rmed the overlap between pathologist-deï¬ned tumour sites\\nand AT2 and cycling AT2 cells predicted by cell2location, suggesting\\ntheir tumour cells status (Fig. 4C). Less overlap was observed for aty-\\npical epithelial cells (Fig. 4C). The differential expression analysis\\n(DEA) of AT2 cells from tumours compared to background showed\\nupregulation of genes involved in hypoxia, TP53 pathways, and\\nmetabolic rewiring in tumours.

As CAMLs co-expressed a wide\\narray of myeloid genes as well as typical epithelial genes (Fig. 1DâF and\\nSupplementary Fig. 1D), had a low doublet score and shared the same\\nCNA signature as tumour cells, we hypothesised that these cells might\\nrepresent a subset of MÉ¸ tightly attached to a cancer cell. It is possible\\nthat these MÉ¸ were undergoing phagocytosis or fusion.\\nCAMLs have been previously isolated from peripheral blood of\\ncancer patients and described to facilitate circulating tumour cells\\nseeding of distant metastases16. Our analysis suggested thatCAMLs can\\nalso be isolated from tumour tissue. To validate that CAMLs are in\\nphysical proximity to tumour cells in situ we examined our STx sec-\\ntions. We calculated across all sections (8 patients, nsections = 20) the\\nPearson correlation between the relative abundance of the cell types\\nthat reside in the same spot and are therefore co-localised. Our analysis\\nshowed that CAMLs indeed co-localised with AT2 cells (Fig. 4G, H). We\\nconï¬rmed this ï¬nding using non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF)\\non the absolute cell-type abundances estimated by cell2location that\\ndeï¬ned factors of co-occurring cell states (Fig. 4I).\\nTo determine the speciï¬c MÉ¸ population from which CAMLs\\nlikely originate, we employed PAGA to elucidate the differentiation\\npath of the myeloid cell population in our tumour dataset (Supple-\\nmentary Fig. 5D). The analysis revealed continuity of the differentia-\\ntion transitions between diverse populations of myeloid cells43. Within\\nthe PAGA trajectory, alveolar MÉ¸ (AMÉ¸) and AIMÉ¸ showed high PAGA\\nconnectivity indicating their high transcriptional similarity. Both AIMÉ¸\\nand AMÉ¸ showed the strongest connectivity on the PAGA trajectory\\nwith STAB1 + MÉ¸ which, in turn, were linked with CAMLs. In line with\\ntrajectory analysis, CAMLs co-expressed many of the genes speciï¬c to\\nSTAB1 + MÉ¸ (Supplementary Fig. 2A), supporting the hypothesis that\\nCAMLs are likely derived from STAB1 + MÉ¸ following their close\\ninteraction with tumour cells. Finally, DEA analysis between CAMLs\\nfrom LUSC versus LUAD patients, showed upregulation of KRT17, KRT5\\nand KRT6A in LUSC samples (SupplementaryData 17). These KRT genes\\nwere previously identiï¬ed as markers of LUSC in multiple studies44,45,\\nwhich supports hypothesis that CAMLs arise from the interaction\\nbetween MÉ¸ and tumour cell.\\nTAMs promote cholesterol and iron efï¬ux in tumour\\nMÉ¸, traditionally categorised into distinct M1 (classically activated)\\nand M2 (alternatively activated) phenotypes, are now understood to\\nexist along a dynamic spectrum of functional states46. This concept of\\nMÉ¸ plasticity underscores their ability to seamlessly transition\\nbetween pro-inï¬ammatory and anti-inï¬ammatory roles in response to\\nintricate cues from their microenvironment (Supplementary Fig. 5D).\\nTo better understand the transcriptional changes that different MÉ¸\\npopulations undergo in the TME, we performed DEA. In tumours, both\\nAMÉ¸ and AIMÉ¸ upregulated genes involved in cholesterol and lipid\\ntransport and metabolism (such as ABCA1, APOC1, APOE, FABP3 and\\nFABP5) compared to the background tissue (Fig. 5A, B and Supple-\\nmentary Data 18 and 19). Cholesterol plays a vital role in tumour\\ngrowth due to the high demand of newly synthesised cellular mem-\\nbranes during cancer cell proliferation. Hypoxia-related genes were\\nupregulated in AT2 cells in tumour compared to the background\\n(Fig. 4D), which can promote cholesterol auxotrophy in tumour cells\\nby suppressing cholesterol synthesis, thereby forcing them to rely on\\nexogenous cholesterol uptake47. In our dataset, we detected higher\\nexpression of the cholesterol exporter ABCA1 and no expression of\\nlow-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in AMÉ¸ and AIMÉ¸, the latter\\ngene being responsible for the uptake of cholesterol-carrying lipo-\\nprotein particles into cells, suggesting preferential export of choles-\\nterol from TAMs to the TME (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, we also noted a\\nhigh expression of TREM2 in both AMÉ¸ and AIMÉ¸ (Fig. 5A), which plays\\na prominent role in efï¬ux of cholesterol in microglia48â50. To validate\\nthe increased levels of cholesterol in the TME, we stained matched\\ntumour and background tissue sections with BODIPYâ¢493/503, a stain\\ntargeting cholesterol and other neutral lipids. We found a signiï¬cant\\nincrease in the BODIPY signal in the tumour sections, compared to\\nbackground tissue (Fig. 5C, D), conï¬rming an increased availability of\\nneutral lipids in the tumour, possibly as a result of an increased export\\nby TAMs.\\nSTAB1 + MÉ¸ were identiï¬ed in the tumour resections (Fig. 5EâH,\\nSupplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Notes), so we used DEA to\\nidentify a set of genes that were speciï¬c for STAB1 + MÉ¸ compared to\\ntumour AIMÉ¸ or AMÉ¸. We identiï¬ed 20 genes, from hereonreferred to\\nas âSTAB1 signature genesâ (Fig. 5I). Interestingly, STAB1 + MÉ¸ uniquely\\nexpressed SLC40A1, which encodes for the ferroportin, the only known\\nprotein that exports ferrous iron from the cytoplasm across the plasma\\nmembrane and is key for the iron-releasing activity of macrophages\\n(Fig. 5I, J and Supplementary Data 20 and 21)51. Ferroportin-mediated\\nrelease of free iron by M2 MÉ¸ was reported to promote the pro-\\nliferation of renal carcinoma cells in vitro, possibly by supporting the\\nhigh iron requirement due to increased DNA synthesis52. Furthermore,\\ncompared to AMÉ¸, STAB1 + MÉ¸ expressed lower levels of ferritin heavy\\nchain 1 (FTH1) and ferritin light chain (FTL) encoding for the iron storer\\nferritin (Fig. 5J and Supplementary Data 20). Consistent with the\\nhypothesis of their sustained export of free iron to the extracellular\\nmilieu, STAB1 + MÉ¸ downregulated genes involved in iron sequestra-\\ntion (Fig. 5K). Taken together, our analysis suggests that macrophages\\nundergo âreprogrammingâ within the TME and adopt a transcriptional\\nsignature that facilitates cholesterol efï¬ux and iron export, thus sup-\\nporting tumour progression.\\nSTAB1 + MÉ¸ in tumour tissue undergo oncofoetal\\nreprogramming\\nEmbryonic development shares many characteristics with tumour\\ntissue, including rapid cell division, cellular ï¬exibility, and a highly\\nvascular microenvironment. It has been recently reported that during\\ntumorigenesis, MÉ¸ can undergo oncofoetal reprogramming53 and\\nacquire a foetal-like transcriptional identity that supports tumour\\ngrowth and metastasis53. Considering that some of the STAB1 signature\\ngenes are typically expressed by foetal MÉ¸ (such as STAB1, FOLR2,\\nFig. 4 | CAMLs share tumour CNAs and colocalise with tumour cells.

The cluster of âHES1+ macrophagesâ identiï¬ed in MoMac-\\nVERSE showed the highest expression of the âSTAB1 signature genesâ\\n(Fig. 6D, E). Similar to STAB1 + MÉ¸, HES1+ macrophages accumulated in\\ntumours of lung cancer patients but also liver cancer patients57 and\\nwere suggested to represent a cluster of âlong-term resident-likeâ MÉ¸\\nwith foetal-like transcriptional signature56. In contrast, âC1Qâ MÉ¸ from\\nMoMac-VERSE, which have been described as lung alveolar MÉ¸, had a\\nhigh expression of genes unique to our tumour alveolar AMÉ¸ (from\\nhere on referred as âAMÉ¸ signature genesâ, Fig. 6F, H). In the context of\\nfoetal lung, a rare population of APOE + MÉ¸, which accounted for less\\nthan 1% of all foetal lung macrophages reported in ref. 55, had a high\\nAMÉ¸ signature genes score (Supplementary Notes and Fig. 6G, I, see\\nâMethodsâ).\\nTaken together, our analysis suggests that tumour macrophages,\\nespecially STAB1 + MÉ¸, exhibited a transcriptional signature reminis-\\ncent of MÉ¸ during foetal lung development, suggesting that they have\\nundergone oncofoetal reprogramming within the NSCLC tumour\\nenvironment.\\nDiscussion\\nOur study represents a large single-cell multiomics analysis of samples\\ncollected from treatment-naive patients with NSCLC. We integrated\\nscRNA-seq data from nearly 900,000 cells from tumour resections and\\nadjacent non-malignant tissue from 25 treatment- naive patients with\\nspatial transcriptomics to build an atlas of immune and non-immune\\ncompartments in lung cancer.\\nLUAD and LUSC, the two most common NSCLC subtypes, exhibit\\nmarkedly different prognostic outcomes and have shown potential for\\nsubtype-speciï¬c therapies28. Despite similar cell-type composition, we\\nobserved signiï¬cant differences in the co-expression of several ICIs\\nand inhibitory molecules between LUAD and LUSC, highlighting ther-\\napeutic opportunities. LUAD samples frequently expressed TIGIT and\\nTIM3 (HAVCR2), while in LUSC we found the putative ICI CD96-NECTIN1.\\nWhile different advanced clinical trials targeting TIGIT, including in\\npatients affected by NSCLC, are ongoing58, progress on TIM3 and CD96\\nis more limited59. A ï¬rst-in-human phase-I study evaluating the anti-\\nCD96 monoclonal antibody GSK6097608 as monotherapy alone or in\\ncombination with anti-PD1 (dostarlimab) started recruiting patients\\nonly recently60. Taken together, our data suggest that LUAD and LUSC\\npatients might beneï¬t from speciï¬c immunotherapy targeting ICIs as\\nTIM3, TIGIT and CD96.\\nThe TME plays a crucial role in modulating the population and\\nbehaviour of MÉ¸4. We found that, compared to the adjacent non-\\ntumour tissue, tumour resections harboured a lower proportion of\\nmonocytes but a higher proportion of monocyte-derived cells, such as\\nmo-DC2s and anti-inï¬ammatory MÉ¸, suggestive of an enhanced\\nmonocyte differentiation in the TME7,9. The prevalence of anti-\\ninï¬ammatory MÉ¸, including STAB1 + MÉ¸, exhibited an inverse rela-\\ntionship with the abundance of natural killer (NK) cells and T cells in\\nthe tumour environment; and the NK cells within the tumour exhibited\\nreduced cytotoxic activity. Our results are in line with the recent\\nï¬ndings that the removal of tumour cell debris by lung MÉ¸ leads to\\ntheir conversion into an immunosuppressive phenotype, conse-\\nquently hindering the inï¬ltration of NK cells into the TME27. MÉ¸ with\\nelevated levels of tumoural debris were reported to upregulate genes\\ninvolved in cholesterol trafï¬cking and lipid metabolism, a character-\\nistic shared with anti-inï¬ammatory MÉ¸ in our dataset. As a result, they\\ndownregulated co-stimulatory molecules, cytokines and chemokines27\\nessential for the recruitment of CD8 + T cells, therefore becoming\\nmore immunosuppressive.\\nAmong the MÉ¸ population within tumours, we also identiï¬ed\\nSTAB1 + MÉ¸ that exhibited the highest level of immunosuppression\\nmarkers. These STAB1 + MÉ¸ displayed a gene expression pattern akin\\nto that of foetal lung MÉ¸ and demonstrated a modiï¬ed iron metabo-\\nlism, marked by the increased expression of genes associated with iron\\nrelease in the TME. Therefore, we hypothesise that STAB1 + MÉ¸ might\\nplay a crucial role in supporting tumour progression by sustaining the\\nincreased iron requirement of highly-cycling tumour cells52,61. In a\\nsubcutaneous LLC1 Lewis lung adenocarcinoma model, mice lacking\\nStab1 expression in MÉ¸, tumour growth was diminished. This outcome\\nwas attributed to a shift towards a pro-inï¬ammatory phenotype in\\nTAM and a robust inï¬ltration of CD8 + T cells within the TME62.\\nSTAB1 + MÉ¸ displayed a transcriptional resemblance to CAMLs, which\\nconcurrently expressed genes associated with both MÉ¸ and epithelial\\ncells, and exhibited copy number alterations (CNAs) similar to those\\nfound in tumour cells. STAB1+ plays a pivotal role in facilitating the\\nadhesion and engulfment of apoptotic cells by engaging in a speciï¬c\\ninteraction with phosphatidylserine, supporting the hypothesis of a\\nstrong interaction of a MÉ¸ with a tumour cell in CAMLs63. In previous\\nstudies, CAMLs were identiï¬ed by immunoï¬uorescence in the per-\\nipheral blood of individuals affected by various solid tumours and\\nwere proposed to facilitate the dissemination and establishment of\\ncirculating tumour cells in distant metastatic sites16. Here, we report\\ntheir presence in multiple tumour resections, based on a combination\\nof a compound gene expression signature, tumour-speciï¬c copy\\nnumber alterations and physical proximity to tumour cells, as evident\\nfrom\\nVisium\\nsections.\\nTaken\\ntogether,\\nour\\ncomprehensive\\ndataset allowed identifying a multitude of molecular changes in the\\nMÉ¸ population of the lung tumour microenvironment, which will help\\npave\\nthe\\nway\\nfor\\nthe\\ndevelopment\\nof\\ntherapeutic\\nstrategies\\nagainst NSCLC.\\nMethods\\nEthics and tissue acquisition\\nTissue used in the research study was obtained from the Papworth\\nHospital Research Tissue Bank.

Human tumour and adjacent background tissues, collected from\\nthe edges of the lungs, were obtained from 25 patients following\\ntumour resection. Human healthy lung samples were obtained from\\ntwo healthy deceased donors. Both healthy samples were evaluated by\\nan expert pathologist to exclude the presence of malignancies. The\\nhuman material was provided by the Royal Papworth Tissue Bank\\n(T02229), in accordance with the HMDMC Human Tissue Act Sample\\nCustodian Form Version 7.0 (UK NRES REC approval reference num-\\nber(s): 08/H0304/56 + 5; HMDMC 16 | 094). NSCLC FFPE tumour\\nblocks (n = 2) used for validation of STAB1+ macrophages with Akoya\\nwere obtained from 2 different donors and purchased from BioIVT (ex-\\nAsterand Bioscience). Informed Consent Form (ICF) and Institutional\\nReview Board Approval Letter (IRBA) were obtained for all tissue\\nsamples.\\nSex was assigned (15 male and 12 female patients/donors). Sex-\\nbased analyses were not performed due to the limited sample size.\\nGender was not determined.\\nTissue processing\\nTissues were kept in cold complete RPMI medium (RPMI [Invitrogen]\\nsupplemented with 10% FBS [Sigma Millipore, catalogue number:\\nF9665], 2 mM L-Glutamine [Life Technologies, catalogue number:\\n25030-024] and 100 U/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin [Thermoï¬sher, cat-\\nalogue number: 15140122]) until dissociation, which was performed on\\nthe same day of collection.

Cells were\\ncentrifuged for 5 min at 300 Ã g, 4 Â°C, resuspended in 500 Î¼l of 5% FBS\\nin PBS and subsequently ï¬ltered into polypropylene FACS tubes.\\nImmune cells were sorted as live, CD45 + ; MDSC were sorted as\\nlive, CD45 + , Lineage- (Lin: CD3, CD56, CD19), CD33 + , HLA-DR-/low\\n(Supplementary Data 22 and Supplementary Fig. 1A). Cells were sorted\\ninto a 1.5-ml tube, counted and submitted for 10x scRNA-seq library\\npreparation.\\nscRNA sequencing\\nEach cell suspension was submitted for 3â single-cell RNA sequencing\\nusing Single Cell G Chip Kit, chemistry v3.1 (10x Genomics Pleasanton,\\nCA,\\nUSA),\\nfollowing\\nthe\\nmanufacturerâs\\ninstructions.\\nLibraries\\nwere sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000, and mapped to the\\nGRCh38 human reference genome using the CellRanger toolkit (ver-\\nsion 3.1.0).\\nscRNA sequencing data analysis\\nIntegrating numerous samples, notably from diverse cancer subtypes\\nand adjacent normal tissues, is challenging due to variations in gene\\nprogrammes between samples. Consequently, these differences often\\nhinder a coherent biological alignment when attempting simultaneous\\nembedding. Most current integration techniques, primarily focused on\\nbatch correction, operate under the assumption of shared cell states\\nacross samples. However, while they aim to mitigate technical dis-\\nparities, they might inadvertently erase genuine biological distinc-\\ntions. Therefore, we applied the QC ï¬ltration and doublet removal on\\nthe merged dataset (Tumour + B/H) but we split the datasets between\\ntumour and B/H for HVG selection, PCA, batch correction (using Har-\\nmony), clustering and annotations.\\nStarting from the unnormalised, uncorrected gene expression\\nmatrices produced (per sample) by the CellRanger protocol, we per-\\nformed careful downstream analysis of the scRNA-seq data. For each\\nCellRanger output (corresponding to a speciï¬c technical and biologi-\\ncal replicate of the separate tumour, background and healthy data) we\\nidentiï¬ed low-quality cells or empty droplets by applying the barco-\\ndeRanks and emptyDrops functions using the R package DropletUtils64.\\nFollowing per-sample droplets removal, the complete set of cell\\nexpression matrices was merged (we merged tumour, background,\\nand healthy samples), and quality control (QC) was applied to the\\nresultant merged matrix. The remaining analysis is implemented using\\nstandard approaches in the Scanpy65 framework. The QC is based on\\nthree parameters: the total UMI count (lower-upper threshold [400,\\n100,000]), the number of detected genes (lower-upper threshold [180,\\n6000]), and the proportion of mitochondrial gene count per cell (20%\\nfraction upper bound). We applied Scrublet 66 to remove potential\\ndoublets with 0.06 as the expected doublet rate and then ï¬ltered the\\nresults using the parameter values (2 for minimum read count of cell, 3\\nfor minimum detected cell of gene, 85 for minimum gene variability\\npercentage, and 30 for the number of principal components used to\\nembed the transcriptomes prior to k-nearest-neighbour graph con-\\nstruction). The resulting merged and ï¬ltered expression matrix is then\\nnormalised using the scaling factor 10,000, followed by log1p\\ntransformation.\\nFor dimensionality reduction, we ï¬rst selected sets of highly-\\nvariable genes (HVGs) from the initial gene set of 25,718. Starting from\\nthe HVG selection, the merged matrix was split into two separate\\nmatrices: tumour, and combined background/healthy which we refer\\nto as B/H. After HVG selection, 1604 genes were selected from the\\ntumour matrix and 1486 from B/H. From these separate HVG sets, we\\napplied dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis\\n(PCA). Next, we performed PCA separately for tumour and for B/H and\\nretained the top 15 components, according to the Scree plot elbow\\nrule. The resulting matrix is then batch corrected to account for\\nadditional technical variations arising between samples which are non-\\nbiological in origin. We apply batch correction by using harmonypy (a\\nPython version of the original harmonyR67 package), based on\\nrecommended benchmarking68 against other procedures.\\nFollowing between-sample batch correction, we computed a\\nneighbourhood graph and applied Leiden69 clustering (with Leiden\\nresolution being 1) to the 15-dimensional harmonised PCA space69. For\\nvisualisation purposes, we used Uniform Manifold Approximation and\\nProjection (UMAP) manifold embedding70 to capture the global fea-\\ntures of the 15-dimensional clustered manifold and represent the glo-\\nbal structure in two and three dimensions. We identiï¬ed top 100\\nrepresentative genes for each cluster by performing the Wilcoxon\\nsigned-rank test71 with the Bonferroni correction, followed by a ï¬lter-\\ning to obtain genes overexpressed in the target group (minimum log\\nfold change as 0) and expressed in at least 30% of cells within the\\ngroup. We did not control the fraction of gene expression of other\\nclusters, by setting the maximum threshold as 100%. We then anno-\\ntated each cell cluster according to the the expression proï¬le of these\\nArticle\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48700-8\\nNature Communications|   (2024) 15:4388 \\n12\\nmarker genes and the expression of other canonical genes signiï¬cant\\nfor different lung cell types based on the literature (see extended\\nresults). The annotation procedure was done iteratively. With this\\napproach we generated two separate annotated UMAPs, together with\\nassociated marker genes, for the tumour and B/H datasets.\\nContrasting cell-type abundances between different samples\\nTo compare cell-type abundances, we calculated the proportion of\\neach cell type within each patient and broad cell annotation in the\\nunenriched (CD235-) samples. We contrasted cell-type proportions\\nbetween groups (tumour vs. background or LUAD vs. LUSC) using a\\nWilcoxon rank-sum test. Finally, we corrected for multiple testing\\nusing a two-sided Bonferroni correction independently for each group\\nanalysed.\\nThe association between the relative cell-type abundance for each\\nimmune cell type was evaluated on the Pearsonâs product-moment\\ncorrelation coefï¬cients.\\nLabel transfer\\nTo test consistency in cell-type annotation performed separately in\\ntumour and B/H, we performed reference-query mapping from\\ntumour to B/H using scArches22. For the 828,191 immune cells (464,952\\nin tumour and 363,239 in B/H) identiï¬ed through our separate anno-\\ntations, we selected a common set of 10,000 HVGs. We ï¬rst built an\\nscVI model and trained it on the tumour dataset using broad cell types\\nfor reference, and applied scHPL method (provided in the scArches\\npackage, parameters set to use KNN classiï¬er, 100 neighbours and\\nwith PCA dimensionality reduction) to obtain the hierarchy for the\\ntumour cell types. We then applied the B/H dataset to the pretrained\\nreference model for a query, and predicted B/H broad cell types based\\non tumour hierarchy (probability threshold set as 0.2). Finally, we\\ncompared the predicted cell types with our separate annotations in B/\\nH using a heatmap to visualise the confusion matrix.\\nCellPhoneDB\\nWe initially identiï¬ed a putative long list of cellâcell interactions dif-\\nferentially observed in the tumour environment by inferring statisti-\\ncally signiï¬cant ligandâreceptor pairs, and their corresponding cell\\ntypes, using CellPhoneDB29. We treated the tumour (LUAD or LUSC),\\nbackground, and healthy scRNA-seq proï¬les as independent datasets\\nand ran CellPhoneDB separately. To reduce the impact of randomness\\nin the way CellPhoneDB samples from input datasets, we required that\\nany ligandâreceptor pair of interest from the CellPhoneDB database be\\nexpressed in at least 30% of cells in a particular cell-type cluster of\\ninterest. The ï¬nal ligandâreceptor lists were further ï¬ltered by\\nrequiring that the mean log(1 + expression) of the ligandâreceptor pair\\nbe greater than 1.0, and the Bonferroni-adjusted72 P value be less than\\n0.01. From these ï¬ltered long lists, ligandâreceptor pairs and corre-\\nsponding cell types relevant to the tumour data are identiï¬ed.\\nWhen evaluating the ligandâreceptor lists calculated with Cell-\\nPhoneDB, we did not run on the complete datasets due to the difï¬culty\\nin scaling up the CellPhoneDB statistical permutation tests to scRNA-\\nseq with more than 106 cells. Instead, we separately stratiï¬ed the\\ntumour, healthy and background datasets such that the proportion of\\ncell types, patients, and samples in the reduced 50% of the data reca-\\npitulated the proportions in the full dataset.\\nDifferential expression analysis\\nDifferentiation expression analysis (DEA) was performed for AT2 cells,\\nanti-inï¬ammatory macrophages and alveolar macrophages using a\\npseudo-bulk approach to compare tumour versus background. Pseu-\\ndobulks were built for each patient by summing raw gene counts\\nacross all cells in each cell type investigated. The patients 1 and 4 were\\nnot included in the analysis as their cancer subtype and stage were not\\nknown at the time of analysis. Since there were differences in the cell\\ncount between datasets we downsampled the biggest cluster to the\\nsize of the smaller. The downsampling routine was repeated 100 times,\\nsuch that 100 new datasets were created that match the smaller\\ndataset. DEA was performed using sample-level pseudobulks and a\\nPythonic version of the DESeq2 pipeline (py_DESeq2), including the\\npatient information as co-variate73. The median adjusted p value by\\nBenjaminiâHochberg procedure and median log2FC for each differ-\\nentially expressed gene (DEG) was calculated across 100 iterations. We\\nveriï¬ed the robustness of this choice of 100 iterations by visualising\\nthe variability of the median p value across iterations, in order to assess\\nits stability (Supplementary Fig. 6C). DEGs were ï¬ltered with med-\\nian(padj)â¤0.05 and |median(logFC)|â¥1. Prior to performing over-\\nrepresentation analysis, the genes that were commonly upregulated in\\nmore than 50% of the contrasts were removed (DNAJB1, HSPA1A,\\nHSPA1B, HSPB1, HSPE1, IGHA1, IGKC, IGLC2). DEGs were used to per-\\nform gene ontology (GO) overrepresentation using the clusterProï¬ler\\npackage74. To deï¬ne STAB1 + MÉ¸ and AMÉ¸ gene signatures, we com-\\npared DEA results and intersected the genes signiï¬cantly upregulated\\nby STAB1 + MÉ¸ (or AMÉ¸) compared to the other MÉ¸ populations in\\ntumour.\\nTrajectory inferenceâPAGA\\nTo analyse myeloid cell trajectory in tumour dataset, we recomputed a\\nneighbourhood graph from the same 15-dimensional harmonised PCA\\nspace as above, but only within myeloid cell populations. We next\\napplied PAGA38 within the Scanpy65 package to the neighbourhood\\ngraph. In parallel, we computed the diffusion map and its force-\\ndirected layout for visualisation using the Pegasus package75. We ï¬nally\\noverlaid the PAGA network with the diffusion map using the scVelo\\npackage. We repeated the same analysis workï¬ow but on non-immune\\ncells in the tumour dataset.\\nCopy number analysis\\nWe applied the CopyKAT package to the single-cell RNA-seq data to\\nobtain copy number calls. The Copykat pipeline was extended to\\nobtain conï¬dent copy number calls per cell, per chromosome arm,\\nbeyond the hierarchical clustering the standard pipeline produces.\\nPer cell copy number calls were obtained as follows: ï¬rst, the\\nregular CopyKAT (v1.0.5) pipeline was run on the unmodiï¬ed UMI\\ncounts of a particular patient/environment (i.e., tumour or back-\\nground) combination with default parameters, except for norm.cell.-\\nnames. The norm.cell.names parameter allows for specifying which\\ncells are used as conï¬dent diploid normals during expression nor-\\nmalisation. CopyKAT was set to use all cells labelled as cDC2 dendritic\\ncells, as they are available in great numbers across all patients and an\\ninitial inspection of their expression proï¬les revealed no systematic\\ncopy number alterations.\\nAfter CopyKAT has completed, a calling step was applied that is\\naimed to call whole chromosome arm alterations in individual cells. We\\nreasoned that, on a chromosome arm basis, the distribution of binned-\\nand-normalised expression from CopyKAT should be signiï¬cantly\\ndifferent (higher or lower) than the distribution of the same bins in all\\nconï¬dently diploid cells. For each chromosome arm, we model the\\ndistribution of all data bins from the conï¬dently diploid cells as a\\nnormal distribution. Each bin on that same chromosome arm from a\\ncandidate aneuploid cell is then tested against that distribution.\\nFinally, when more than 50% of bins across that chromosome arm are\\nsigniï¬cant, the arm is marked as altered in that cell.\\nThe above-described procedure yields a conservative true/false\\ncall per cell, per chromosome arm without directly distinguishing\\nbetween gains and losses. To obtain a proï¬le with gains and losses as is\\nshown in Fig. 4A, we discretise the values for each bin in each cell: If the\\narm is altered and the expression value of the bin is negative: â1, if the\\narm is altered and the expression value is positive: +1, if the arm is\\nunaltered: 0. The discretized values are then ï¬nally summed per bin\\nArticle\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48700-8\\nNature Communications|   (2024) 15:4388 \\n13\\nacross all cells of a particular cell type and divided by the number of\\ncells of that cell type to obtain the fraction of cells with an alteration as\\nshown in Fig. 4A.\\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC) and neutral lipid staining\\nTissues were frozen in dry-ice-cooled isopentane and stored in air-tight\\ntissue cryovials at â80 Â°C. The tissues were embedded in an optimal\\ncutting temperature compound (OCT) and cryosectioned in a pre-\\ncooled cryostat at 10 Î¼m thickness on SuperFrost slides. On the day of\\nthe experiment, slides were thawed at room temperature for less than\\n5 min, then immersed in a ï¬xation solution (4% PFA in PBS) for 20 min.\\nAfter three washes with PBS, each section was permeabilized with\\nfreshly prepared 0.2% Triton-X100 (Sigma Aldrich) for 10 min at room\\ntemperatures, followed by three washes in PBS. Unspeciï¬c binding was\\nblocked by incubating the sections in PBS + 2.5% BSA for 1 h at room\\ntemperature. Following two washes in PBS, sections were incubated\\nwith recombinant rabbit anti-CD68 (Abcam ab213363, 1:50) and mouse\\nanti-STAB1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-293254, 10 Âµg/ml) in PBS +\\n0.5% BSA overnight at 4 Â°C. Primary antibodies were removed and\\nsections washed three times with PBS, then incubated with the\\nappropriate secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 594 and\\ngoat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488 Abcam) 1:500 in PBS + 0.5% BSA for\\n2 h at room temperature, protected from light. Two confocal immu-\\nnohistochemistry z-stacks each for tumour and background tissue\\nfrom three patients were analysed. Using Fiji (ImageJ) software, the\\nSTAB1+ and CD68+ areas were segmented by automatic thresholding\\nand quantiï¬ed in each image of the z-stack.\\nTo assess the levels of cholesterol and neutral lipids we further\\nstained tumour and background tissue sections with BODIPYâ¢493/\\n503 (Invitrogen). After three washes in PBS, sections were incubated\\nwith a 10 Âµg/ml solution of BODIPYâ¢493/503 in PBS (1:100 from a\\nstock 1 mg/ml solution in DMSO) for 15 min at room temperature.\\nFollowing four washes in PBS, sections were incubated for 90 s with\\nTrueVIEW (Vector Laboratories), washed by immersing in PBS for\\n5 min, then tap-dried and mounted in VECTASHIELD Vibranceâ¢Anti-\\nfade. Sections were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope\\nat Ã20 (Plan-Apochromat Ã20/0.8 M27) and Ã63 (Plan-Apochromat\\nÃ63/1.40 Oil DIC M27) magniï¬cation. Tile scans were set to cover an\\narea of 3541 Ã 3542 microns for all sections. ImageJ was used to remove\\nbackground BODIPY signals and calculate the area covered by the\\nthresholded BODIPY on the stitched images. To compare the area\\ncovered by BODIPY in tumour and background, we used a paired t test\\nat a patient level, after conï¬rming the normal distribution of the data\\nusing a ShapiroâWilk test.\\nFoetal lung integration\\nTo investigate the oncofetal reprogramming of myeloid cells in\\nNSCLC, we took advantage of a published scRNA-seq dataset of foetal\\nlung myeloid cells55 and the published âMoMac-VERSEâ[ 56. The\\nexpression of the âSTAB1 signature genesâ and of the âAMÉ¸ signature\\ngenesâ across lung foetal myeloid cells was determined using the\\nAddModuleScore function in Seurat v4.3. To combine foetal lung and\\nadult lung tumour-inï¬ltrating myeloid cells, we isolated the myeloid\\ncells from our tumour and background datasets and integrated those\\nwith the aforementioned foetallung myeloid dataset using the Pegasus\\npackage, following the following workï¬ow: (i) remove rarely expressed\\ngenes (less than 10 cells), normalisation and log1p transformation, (ii)\\nrobust and highly-variable gene selection, (iii) PCA with optimal PC\\nnumber determined by random matrix theory (resulting in 75 PCs), (iv)\\nbatch effect correction using Harmony67, and (v) Leiden clustering on\\nneighbourhood graph. The dendrogram was built by estimating the\\ncorrelation distance between cell types on the harmonised PC\\nembedding space, under complete linkage criterion of hierarchical\\nclustering. The UMAP was computed to obtain a 2D summary of the\\nharmonised PC space.\\n10x Genomics Visium spatial transcriptomics\\nTissues were frozen in dry-ice-cooled isopentane and stored in air-tight\\ntissue cryovials at â80 Â°C. Prior to undertaking any spatial tran-\\nscriptomics protocol, the tissues were embedded in OCT compound\\nand tested for RNA quality with an Agilent BioAnalyser. Tissues with\\nRNA integrity (RIN) values > 7 were cryosectioned in a pre-cooled\\ncryostat at 10 Î¼m thickness. Two consecutive sections were cryosec-\\ntioned at 10 Î¼m thickness in a pre-cooled cryostat and transferred to\\nthe four 6.5 mm Ã 6.5 mm capture areas of the gene expression slide.\\nSlides were ï¬xed in methanol for 30 min prior to staining with H&E and\\nthen imaged using the Nanozoomer slide scanner. The tissues under-\\nwent permeabilization for 24 min. Reverse transcription and second\\nstrand synthesis was performed on the slide with cDNA quantiï¬cation\\nusing qRT-PCR using KAPA SYBR FAST-qPCR kit (KAPA Biosystems)\\nand analysed on the QuantStudio (ThermoFisher). Following library\\nconstruction, these were quantiï¬ed and pooled at 2.25 nM con-\\ncentration. Pooled libraries from each slide were sequenced on\\nNovaSeq SP (Illumina) using 150 base pair paired-end dual-indexed set-\\nup to obtain a sequencing depth of ~50,000 reads as per 10x Genomics\\nrecommendations. The sequencing libraries were then processed by\\nSpaceRanger (version 1.1.0) on the reference GRCh38 human reference\\ngenome to estimate gene expression on spots.\\nSpatial cell typing with cell2location\\nWe used cell2location34 to deconvolute the cellular composition of\\neach capture area (spot). As our scRNA-seq cells were annotated\\nindependently for tumour and the combined B/H datasets, we applied\\nthe deconvolution model separately as well, using tumour annotation\\nto infer spatial cell composition of tumour sections, and background\\nannotations for background datasets. Only spots with total UMI counts\\nabove 800 were used in downstream analysis.\\nThe cell-type abundance in tumour and background sections were\\ncomputed by summing up the q05 cell abundance, as estimated by\\ncell2location, across spots that passed QC. Cell-type composition was\\ncomputed by normalising each cell typeâs abundance with the total\\nabundance of all cell types. We compared cell-type composition\\nbetween tumour and background with Wilcoxon signed-rank test,\\nfollowed by Bonferroni correction.\\nOn tumour sections, we estimated the correlation distance on\\ncell-type composition across valid spots, applied hierarchical cluster-\\ning with complete linkage, and visualised the results as a dendrogram.\\nIn addition, we applied non-negative matrix factorisation analysis to\\nthe q05 estimation of cell-type abundance with eight factors.\\nLigandâreceptor colocalization analysis\\nTo study the expression of ligandâreceptor pairsonthe 10X Visium, we\\nï¬rst binarised the expression of each gene in the LR pairs in the spots\\nthat passed QC. We considered a gene being expressed in a spot if its\\ncell2location estimated abundance were higher than the median\\ncounts for that gene in the corresponding section. We counted spots\\nwhere both genes in each LR pair were either co-expressed or not, in\\ntumour and background sections from the same patient, and subse-\\nquently, applied the Ï2 test on the contingency table. To correct for\\nmultiple comparisons, we adjusted the P value using a conservative\\nBonferroni correction for all the LRs enriched in tumours in the cell-\\nphoneDB analysis (309 * 8 patients). LRs were considered signiï¬cantly\\nenriched in tumour if the Bonferroni-adjusted P value was lower than\\n0.05 in at least four patients.\\nMultiplexed Immunoï¬uorescence\\n5 Î¼m thick sections were generated from NSCLC FFPE tumour blocks.\\nAn antibody cocktail was prepared with optimal dilutions of each of\\nthe following conjugated antibodies: anti-human Stabilin-1 antibody\\n(clone #840449, catalogue #MAB3825, R&D systems) was conjugated\\nto a custom oligo barcode according to instructions in Akoya\\nArticle\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48700-8\\nNature Communications|   (2024) 15:4388 \\n14\\nBiosciencesâ antibody conjugation kit (Conjugation kit, #7000009;\\nAkoya) while human CD68 (clone #KP1, catalogue #4550113, Akoya)\\nand human PanCK (clone AE-1/AE-3, catalogue #4150020, Akoya) were\\nobtained directly pre-conjugated to oligo barcodes from Akoya Bios-\\nciences.

Here we demonstrate an evolution of sequential \\nfluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH+). We show that \\nseqFISH+ can image mRNAs for 10,000 genes in single cellsâwith \\nhigh accuracy and sub-diffraction-limit resolutionâin the cortex, \\nsubventricular zone and olfactory bulb of mouse brain, using a \\nstandard confocal microscope. The transcriptome-level profiling \\nof seqFISH+ allows unbiased identification of cell classes and \\ntheir spatial organization in tissues. In addition, seqFISH+ reveals \\nsubcellular mRNA localization patterns in cells and ligandâreceptor \\npairs across neighbouring cells. This technology demonstrates the \\nability to generate spatial cell atlases and to perform discovery-\\ndriven studies of biological processes in situ.\\nSpatial genomics, the analysis of the transcriptome and other \\ngenomic information directly in the native context of tissues, is crucial \\nto many fields in biology, including neuroscience and developmen-\\ntal biology. Pioneering work in single-molecule fluorescence in situ \\nhybridization (smFISH) showed that individual mRNA molecules \\ncould be accurately detected in cells6,7. Development of sequential \\nfluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH) to impart a temporal \\nbarcode on RNAs through multiple rounds of hybridization allowed \\nmany molecules to be multiplexed1â3. seqFISH was recently shown to \\nscale to the genome level in vitro8, and could be applied for nascent \\ntranscription active sites9.\\nNevertheless, global profiling of mRNA in cells is hindered by the \\noptical density of transcripts in cells: each mRNA occupies a diffraction- \\nlimited spot in the image and there are tens to hundreds of thousands \\nof mRNAs per cell, depending on the cell type. Thus, optical crowding \\nprevents mRNAs from being resolved and has impeded all implementa-\\ntions of spatial profiling experiments3â5. For example, in situ sequencing \\nmethods detected only around 500 transcripts per cell4,5,10 because of the \\nlow efficiency and large dot size of rolling-circle amplification, whereas \\nseqFISH detected thousands of transcripts per cell3. We previously \\nproposed combining super-resolution microscopy with FISH11 to \\novercome this crowding problem. However, existing super-resolution \\nlocalization microscopy12,13 relies on the\\xa0detection of single dye mole-\\ncules, which emit a limited number of photons and only work robustly \\nin optically thin (less than 1\\xa0Âµm) samples.\\nTo enable discovery-driven approaches in situ, it is essential to scale \\nup the spatial multiplexed methods to the genome level. To date, spatial \\nmethods have relied on existing genomics methods, such as single-cell \\nRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)\\xa0analysis, to identify target genes, and \\nthey\\xa0serve only\\xa0to map cell types identified by scRNA-seq. At the level \\nof hundreds and even a thousand genes, spatial methods cannot be \\nused as a de novo discovery-driven tool; this is a major disadvantage \\nof the technology. In addition, many genes are expressed in a spatially \\ndependent fashion independent of cell types14, and this\\xa0information is \\nlost when analysing dissociated cells.\\nHere we demonstrate seqFISH+, which achieves super-resolution \\nimaging and multiplexing of 10,000 genes in a\\xa0single cell using \\nsequential hybridizations and imaging with a standard confocal \\nmicroscope. The key to seqFISH+ is expansion of the barcode base \\npalette from four or five coloursâas used in seqFISH1,3 and in situ \\nsequencing experiments4,5âto a much larger palette of âpseudoco-\\nloursâ (Fig.\\xa01a) by sequential hybridization. By using 60 pseudocol-\\nour channels, we effectively dilute mRNA molecules into 60 separate \\nimages and enable each mRNA dot to be localized below the dif-\\nfraction limit12,15,16, before recombining the images to reconstruct a \\nsuper-resolution image. We separate the 60 pseudocolours into three \\nfluorescent channels (Alexa Fluor 488, Cy3b and Alexa Fluor 647) \\nand generate barcodes only within each channel to avoid chromatic \\naberrations between channels. Each channel can contain 203 (8,000) \\nbarcoded genes, giving a total of 24,000 genes when repeating this \\npseudocolour imaging four times, with one round used for error \\ncorrection3.\\nAs imaging time is the main bottleneck in spatial transcriptomics \\nexperiments, imaging for seqFISH+ is eightfold faster compared to \\nimplementing seqFISH with expansion microscopy17 (Fig.\\xa01b). Using \\nseqFISH, an equivalent 60-fold expansion of the sample would require \\nfour colours with eight barcoding rounds and 60-fold volume expan-\\nsion, resulting in 1,920 images per field of view (FOV) to cover 47 \\n(that is, 16,384) genes. By contrast, seqFISH+ acquires 60 pseudocolours \\nwith four barcoding rounds, giving 240 images per FOV to cover 24,000 \\ngenesâan eightfold reduction in imaging time. Furthermore, a large \\nnumber of pseudocolours and a shorter four-unit barcode decrease the \\nerrors that accumulate over barcode rounds.\\nTo demonstrate transcriptome-level profiling in cells, we first applied \\nseqFISH+ to cleared NIH/3T3 fibroblast cells18â20 (Fig.\\xa01c, Extended \\nData Figs.\\xa01, 2). We randomly selected 10,000 genes, avoiding highly \\nabundant housekeeping genes, such as ribosomal proteins.

We found \\nmany mRNAs that had not been previously localized to protrusions, \\nin addition to those that had been identified before22,23. We further \\nobserved three distinct subclusters in the perinuclearânuclear-localized \\ntranscripts, and genes in each of these subclusters\\xa0were enriched in \\ndistinct functional roles (Extended Data Fig.\\xa03fâj).\\nTo demonstrate that seqFISH+ works robustly in tissues, we used \\nthe same 10,000-gene probe set to image cells in the cortex, sub- \\nventricular zone (SVZ) (Fig.\\xa03a) and olfactory bulb in two separate \\nsections of mouse brain. We collected 10,000-gene profiles for 2,963 cells \\n(Fig.\\xa03bâe), covering an area of approximately 0.5\\xa0mm2.

Full 3D imaging of cells with seqFISH+ can detect five-\\nto-tenfold more transcripts per cell.\\nWith an unsupervised clustering analysis24, the seqFISH+ \\ncell clusters show clear layer structures (Fig.\\xa03h) and are strongly \\ncorrelated to the clusters in an scRNA-seq25 dataset (Methods, Extended \\nData Figs.\\xa04câf, 5). Similar layer patterns are observed with hidden- \\nMarkov random-field (HMRF) analysis14, in which the expression \\npatterns of neighbouring cells were taken into account (Extended \\nData Figs.\\xa04gâi, 6).\\nWith the seqFISH+ data, we can explore the subcellular localization \\npatterns of 10,000 mRNAs directly in the brain in a cell-type-specific \\nfashion (Supplementary Table\\xa03). In many cell types, the transcripts for \\nSnrnp70, a small nuclear riboprotein, and Nr4a1, a nuclear receptor, \\nare found in the nuclearâperinuclear regions. By contrast, transcripts of \\nthe Na+/K+-ATPase Atp1b2 and the kinesin Kif5a are observed near the \\ncell peripheries in many cell types, including excitatory and inhibitory \\nneurons as well as glial cells. In addition, many transcripts in astrocytes, \\nsuch as Gja1 and Htra1, localize to the cell periphery and processes; these \\nresults were confirmed by smFISH (Fig.\\xa03f, g, Extended Data Fig.\\xa07).\\nWe next explored the spatial organization of the SVZ (Fig.\\xa04a). We \\nidentified neural stem cells (NSCs, clusters 8, 16) expressing astrocyte \\nmarkers Gja1 and Htra1, transit-amplifying progenitors (TAPs, cluster \\n15) expressing Ascl1, Mcm5 and Mki67, and neuroblasts expressing \\nDlx1 and Sp9, consistent with previous studies26.

Endothelial cells adjacent to microglia in \\nthe olfactory bulb express endoglin (Eng, a type III TGFÎ² receptor) and \\nactivin A receptor (Acvrl1 (also known as Alk1), a type I TGFÎ² recep-\\ntor) mRNAs, and the microglia express TGFÎ² ligand (Tgfb1) mRNA. \\nBy contrast, endothelial cells adjacent to microglia in the cortex express \\nLrp1 (also known as Tgfbr5) and Pdgfb, indicating that signalling \\npathways may be used in a tissue-specific fashion. Beyond ligandâ\\nreceptor interactions, we found broadly that gene expression patterns \\nin a particular cell type are highly dependent on the local tissue context \\nof neighbouring cells (Fig.\\xa04e, f, Supplementary Table\\xa04).\\nThese experiments demonstrate that seqFISH+ can robustly profile \\ntranscriptomes in tissues, overcoming optical crowding and removing \\nthe last conceptual roadblock in generating spatial single-cell atlases \\nin tissues. seqFISH+ provides a\\xa0tenfold or\\xa0greater improvement over \\n3\\n3\\n8\\n23\\n14\\n23\\n14\\n3\\n15\\n12\\n3\\n3 3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3 3\\n3\\n312\\n109 9\\n9\\n9 9\\n9\\n99 9\\n9\\n17\\n17\\n10\\n20\\n3\\n3\\n10\\n12\\n12\\n12\\n11\\n23\\n17\\n10\\n3\\n17\\n1\\n10\\n3\\n17 17\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n17\\n10\\n11 10\\n8\\n23\\n23\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n12\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n10\\n3\\n10\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n12\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n23\\n3\\n12\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n9\\n10\\n12\\n9\\n3\\n9\\n9\\n9\\n9\\n3\\n12\\n9\\n9\\n9\\n9 9\\n9\\n9\\n9\\n10 10 12\\n1717\\n3 17\\n12\\n1\\n23\\n12\\n8\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n5\\n3\\n12\\n10\\n20 10\\n5\\n3\\n103\\n9\\n3\\n9\\n9\\n9\\n9\\n9\\n9\\n9\\n9\\n9\\n99\\n8\\n9\\n3\\n17\\n10\\n1717\\n17\\n17\\n12\\n23\\n3\\n3\\n5\\n3\\n12\\n12\\n5\\n23\\n3\\n3\\n12\\n3\\n3\\n9\\n9\\n9\\n12\\n9\\n9\\n9\\n9\\n9\\n9\\n22\\n1\\n5 14\\n1\\n5\\n5 2\\n1\\n5\\n4\\n13\\n5\\n8\\n12\\n15\\n5\\n12\\n2116 2\\n20\\n1\\n1\\n25\\n1\\n5\\n5 5\\n4\\n8\\n1\\n11\\n22\\n1\\n8\\n5\\n5\\n1 2\\n5\\n12\\n12\\n11\\n22\\n5\\n1\\n1\\n18\\n13\\n17\\n5\\n21\\n1\\n10\\n3 3\\n14\\n3\\n20\\n10\\n5\\n17\\n10\\n17\\n5\\n5\\n1\\n8\\n17\\n10\\n17\\n12\\n12\\n17\\n17\\n11\\n17\\n17\\n22\\n8\\n14\\n3\\n2\\n17\\n10\\n22\\n8\\n5\\n5\\n10\\n1\\n2514\\n5 2 1\\n2 5\\n6 1\\n5\\n10\\n25 3\\n1\\n1\\n10\\n5 4\\n12\\n12\\n7\\n21\\n15\\n5\\n5\\n5\\n21\\n17\\n2 8\\n1\\n15 5\\n17\\n4\\n17\\n17\\n5\\n17\\n12\\n2\\n17\\n7\\n1\\n15\\n4\\n4\\n2\\n11\\n13\\n5\\n1 25\\n3\\n5 11 2\\n8\\n2\\n1\\n1\\n15\\n11\\n1\\n11\\n15\\n7 20\\n5\\n1\\n5\\n14 1\\n20\\n1 5\\n1\\n2\\n17 5\\n17\\n5\\n8 8 1\\n10\\n12\\n17\\n8\\n17\\n17\\n1 1\\n10\\n13\\n1\\n8\\n5 1\\n5\\n25\\n1\\n7\\n2\\n1\\n1\\n12\\n5\\n4\\n14\\n5\\n17\\n5\\n10\\n1\\n4\\n4\\n13\\n4\\n1 4\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n5\\n5\\n17\\n18\\n22\\n2\\n5\\n1\\n6\\n5\\n10\\n5\\n1\\n5\\n25\\n10\\n2\\n1\\n1\\n11\\n4\\n10\\n20\\n5\\n5\\n8\\n2\\n8\\n5\\n1\\n5 2\\n8\\n12\\n1025\\n8\\n5\\n8\\n1\\n5 5\\n17\\n5\\n5\\n1 1\\n25\\n17\\n5\\n1\\n3\\n22\\n12 5\\n5\\n1\\n3\\n18\\n5\\n5\\n1 1\\n25\\n1\\n1\\n1712\\n17\\n18\\n11\\n1\\n517 22\\n8\\n8\\n21\\n15\\n15\\n22\\n12\\n12\\n1\\n12\\n21\\n22\\n12\\n11\\n17\\n8\\n1\\n24\\n21\\n14\\n8\\n24\\n15\\n14\\n24\\n21\\n14\\n24\\n12\\n15\\n24\\n12\\n17\\n17\\n21\\n8\\n14\\n17\\n24\\n8\\n24\\n17\\n16\\n10\\n16\\n16\\n16\\n20\\n14\\n11\\n8\\n12\\n7\\n15\\n22\\n14\\n7\\n7\\n7\\n10\\n21\\n2\\n22\\n8\\n7\\n10\\n20\\n1\\n7\\n7\\n2\\n14\\n7\\n14\\n1\\n7\\n10\\n13\\n7\\n10\\n1\\n17\\n7\\n22\\n1\\n12\\n15\\n7\\n2\\n15\\n1\\n15\\n15\\n8\\n23\\n2\\n15\\n12\\n21\\n17\\n22\\n2\\n8\\n14\\n8\\n8\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n15\\n14\\n16\\n25\\n20\\n16\\n16\\n12\\n15\\n23\\n14\\n8\\n11\\n8\\n12\\n21\\n8\\n14\\n12\\n11\\n12\\n12\\n19\\n17\\n17\\n17\\n19\\n15\\n17\\n22\\n8\\n8\\n23\\n20\\n22\\n22\\n22\\n21\\n17\\n14\\n12\\n24\\n22\\n24\\n2\\n24\\n15\\n7\\n12\\n12\\n2\\n26\\n8\\n17\\n17\\n12\\n22\\n12\\n15\\n9\\n8\\n17\\n15\\n22\\n21\\n17\\n14\\n12\\n22\\n22\\n21\\n17\\n13\\n24\\n26\\n12\\n11\\n12\\n22\\n14\\n22\\n17\\n22\\n15\\n11\\n26\\n21\\n11\\n88\\n7\\n8\\n8\\n12\\n24\\n14\\n8\\n22\\n8\\n24\\n12\\n20\\n21\\n14\\n21\\n17\\n20\\n21\\n21\\n21\\n8\\n12\\n8\\n8\\n21\\n17\\n15\\n17\\n14\\n24\\n12\\n15\\n17\\n12\\n15\\n12\\n11\\n21\\n12\\n23\\n8\\n21\\n14\\n24\\n8\\n12\\n17\\n15\\n14\\n24\\n21\\n15\\n26\\n15\\n24\\n14\\n2\\n14\\n17\\n8\\n12\\n14\\n17\\n25\\n8\\n26\\n12\\n11\\n2\\n8\\n20\\n15\\n19\\n15\\n15\\n8\\n16\\n14\\n14\\n16\\n14\\n15\\nSVZ\\nMicroglia\\nAstrocytes\\nEndothelial\\ncells\\nChoroid\\nplexus\\nEpendymal\\ncells\\nOligodendrocytes\\nInterneuron\\nStriatum\\nGL\\nTufted cells\\nOlfactory ensheathing cells\\nEndothelial cells\\nEomes-\\nneuroblast\\nTh and Trh\\nMicroglia\\nTh and Vgf\\nLigand\\nReceptor\\nTgfb1\\nEng\\nAcvrl1\\nMicroglia\\nEndothelial cell\\na\\nCldn5 Selplg\\nEndothelial\\nMicroglia\\nTgfb1 Acvrl1\\nTpd52\\nMgat1\\nHmox1\\nGatsl3\\nSox13\\nKif26a\\nc\\nCluster 3\\nCluster 1\\nTh Vgf Trh\\nMitral cells\\nAstrocytes\\nAstrocytes\\nTh+\\nMCL\\nIPL\\nGCL\\ne\\nf\\nb\\nd\\nOB\\nOB\\nFig. 4 | seqFISH+ reveals ligandâreceptor repertoires in neighbouring \\ncells and spatial organization in tissues. a, Spatial organization of \\ndistinct cell clusters in the SVZ. b, c, Spatially resolved cell-cluster maps of \\nthe mitral cell layer (MCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), granule cell layer \\n(GCL) (b) and glomerular layer (GL) (c) (scale bars, 20\\xa0Î¼m).

No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. \\nThe experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to \\nallocation during experiments and\\xa0outcome assessment.\\nExperiment design. Primary-probe design. Gene-specific primary probes were \\ndesigned as previously described with some modifications8. To obtain probe \\nsets for 10,000 different genes, 28-nucleotide (nt) sequences of each gene were \\nextracted, first using the exons from within the coding region. For genes that did \\nnot yield enough target sequences from the coding region, exons from both the \\ncoding and untranslated regions were used. The masked genome and annotation \\nfrom the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) were used to look up the gene \\nsequences. Probe sequences were required to have GC content within the range \\n45â65%. Any probe sequences that contained five or more consecutive bases of \\nthe same kind were dropped. Any genes that did not achieve a minimum number \\nof 24 probes were dropped. A local BLAST query was run on each probe against \\nthe mouse transcriptome to ensure specificity. BLAST hits on any sequences other \\nthan the target gene with a 15-nt match were considered off targets. ENCODE \\nRNA-seq data across different mouse samples were used to generate an off-target \\ncopy-number table. Any probe that hit an expected total off-target copy number \\nexceeding 10,000 FPKM was dropped to remove housekeeping genes, ribosomal \\ngenes and very highly expressed genes. To minimize cross-hybridization between \\nprobe sets, a local BLAST database was constructed from the probe sequences, and \\nprobes with hits of 17\\xa0nt or longer were removed by dropping the matched probe \\nfrom the larger probe set.\\nReadout-probe design. Readout probes of\\xa015\\xa0nt in length were designed as previ-\\nously described9. In brief, a set of probe sequences was randomly generated with \\ncombinations of A, T, G or C nucleotides. Readout-probe sequences within a \\nGC-content range of 40â60% were selected. We performed a BLAST search against \\nthe mouse transcriptome to ensure the specificity of the readout probes. To mini-\\nmize cross-hybridization of the readout probes, any probes with ten contiguously \\nmatching sequences between readout probes were removed. The reverse com-\\nplements of these readout-probe sequences were included in the primary probes \\naccording to the designed barcodes.\\nPrimary-probe construction. Primary probes were ordered as oligoarray complex \\npools from Twist Bioscience and were constructed as previously described with \\nsome modifications8. In brief, limited PCR cycles were used to amplify the des-\\nignated probe sequences from the oligo complex pool. Then, the amplified PCR \\nproducts were purified using\\xa0the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (28104; Qiagen) \\naccording to the manufacturerâs instructions. The PCR products were used as the \\ntemplate for in vitro transcription (E2040S; NEB) followed by reverse transcription \\n(EP7051; Thermo Fisher) with the forward primer containing a uracil nucleotide31. \\nAfter reverse transcription, the probes were subjected to a\\xa01:30 dilution of uracil- \\nspecific excision reagent (USER) enzyme (N5505S; NEB) treatment to remove the \\nforward primer by cleaving off the uracil nucleotide next to it for ~24 h at 37\\u2009Â°C. \\nSince the reverse complement of T7 sequences was used as the reverse primer, the \\nfinal probe length in this probe set was ~93\\xa0nt. Then, the single-stranded DNA \\n(ssDNA) probes were alkaline hydrolysed with 1 M NaOH at 65\\u2009Â°C for 15 min \\nto degrade the RNA templates, followed by 1 M acetic acid neutralization. \\nNext, to clean up the probes, we performed ethanol precipitation to remove stray \\nnucleotides, phenolâchloroform extraction to remove protein, and used Zeba Spin \\nDesalting Columns (7K MWCO) (89882; Thermo Fisher) to remove any residual \\nnucleotides and phenol contaminants. Then, the probes were mixed with 2 Î¼M \\nof locked nucleic acid (LNA) polyT15 and 2 Î¼M of LNA polyT30 before drying \\nby speed-vac to powder, and resuspended in primary-probe hybridization buffer \\ncomprising 40% formamide (F9027, Sigma), 2Ã SSC (15557036, Thermo Fisher) \\nand 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate (D8906; Sigma). The probes were stored at â20\\u2009Â°C \\nuntil use.\\nReadout-probe synthesis. Readout probes of\\xa015\\xa0nt in length were ordered from \\nIntegrated DNA Technologies as 5â²-amine modified. The construction of readout \\nprobes was similar to that previously described9. In brief, 5 nmol DNA probes was \\nmixed with 25 Î¼g of Alexa Fluor 647âNHS ester or Cy3B or Alexa Fluor 488âNHS \\nester in 0.5 M sodium bicarbonate buffer containing 10% dimethyl fumarate. The \\nreaction was allowed to go on\\xa0for at least 6 h at 37\\u2009Â°C. Then, the DNA probes were \\nsubjected to ethanol precipitation, high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) \\npurification and column purification to remove all contaminants. Once resus-\\npended in water, the readout probes were quantified using Nanodrop and a 500 nM \\nworking stock was made. All the readout probes were stored at â20\\u2009Â°C.\\nCoverslip functionalization. For cell culture experiments, coverslips were cleaned \\nwith a plasma cleaner on a high setting (PDC-001, Harrick Plasma) for 5 min, \\nfollowed by immersion in 1% bind-silane solution (GE; 17-1330-01) made in \\npH\\xa03.5 10% (v/v) acidic ethanol solution for 30 min at room temperature. Then, \\nthe coverslips were rinsed with 100% ethanol three times, and heat-dried in an \\noven at >90\\u2009Â°C for 30 min. Next, the coverslips were treated with 100 Î¼g\\xa0Î¼lâ1 of \\npoly-d-lysine (P6407; Sigma) in water for >1 h at room temperature, followed by \\nthree rinses with water. The coverslips were then air-dried and kept at 4\\u2009Â°C for no \\nlonger than 2 weeks. For mouse brain-slice experiments, coverslips were cleaned \\nwith 1\\xa0M HCl at room temperature for 1 h, rinsed with water once, and treated \\nwith 1\\xa0M NaOH solution at room temperature for 1 h. Then, the coverslips were \\nrinsed three times with water, before immersion in 1% bind-silane solution for 1 h \\nat room temperature. The remaining steps were the same as the coverslip func-\\ntionalization for cell culture.\\nseqFISH+ encoding strategy. We separated the 60 pseudocolours into three fluorescent \\nchannels (Alexa Fluor 488, Cy3b and Alexa Fluor 647) equally. In each channel, the \\n20-pseudocolour imaging was repeated three times, hence achieving 203 (that is, 8,000) \\ngenes barcoding capacity. We performed an extra round of pseudocolour imaging \\nto obtain error-correctable barcodes, an error-correction scheme that we had \\npreviously introduced3. Thus, we obtained 8,000 error-correctable barcodes \\nin three fluorescent channelsâa\\xa024,000 error-correctable barcoding capacity \\nin total. More fluorescent channels and/or more pseudocolours can be added \\neasily to achieve greater dilution of the mRNA density per imaging round. In this \\nexperiment, we encoded 3,333, 3,333 and 3,334 genes in each of the fluorescent \\nchannels. This pseudocolour scheme evolved from the one used in RNA sequential \\nprobing of targets (RNA\\xa0SPOTs)8 and intron seqFISH9, by eliminating chromatic \\naberration and drastically diluting the density to achieve profiling of mRNA at the \\ntranscriptome level in situ.\\nTo visualize the different transcripts, 24 âprimaryâ probes were designed \\nagainst each target mRNA. The primary probes contain overhang sequences \\nthat code for the four-unit base-20 barcode unique to each gene. Hybridization \\nwith fluorophore-labelled readout probes allows the readout of these barcodes and \\nfluorescently labels the subset of genes that contain the corresponding sequences. \\nAll of the genes are sampled every 20 rounds of readout hybridization and collapsed \\ninto super-resolved images. A total of 80 rounds of hybridizations enumerate the \\nfour-unit barcode for each gene. Each round of stripping and readout hybridization \\nis fast and is\\xa0completed in minutes.\\nAfter hybridization\\xa0of primary probes, the samples were subjected to hydro-\\ngel embedding and clearing before seqFISH+ imaging. The details are available \\nin\\xa0the âCell culture experimentâ,\\xa0âTissue slices experimentâ and âseqFISH+ imagingâ \\nsections below.\\nCell culture experiment. NIH/3T3 cells (ATCC) were cultured as previously \\ndescribed8 on the functionalized coverslips to ~80â90% confluence. Then, the \\ncells were washed with 1Ã PBS once\\xa0and fixed with freshly made 4% formalde-\\nhyde (28906; Thermo Fisher) in 1Ã PBS (AM9624, Invitrogen) at room temper-\\nature for 10 min. The fixed cells were permeabilized with 70% ethanol for 1 h \\nat room temperature. The cell samples were dried and the 10,000 gene probes \\n(~1 nM per probe for 24 probes per gene) were hybridized by spreading out using \\nanother coverslip. The hybridization was allowed to proceed for ~36â48 h in a \\nhumid chamber at 37\\u2009Â°C. We found hybridization for 48 h yielded slightly brighter \\nsignals. After hybridization, the samples were washed with 40% formamide in 2Ã \\nSSC at 37\\u2009Â°C for 30 min, followed by three rinses with 1 ml 2Ã SSC. Next, the cell \\nsamples were incubated with a\\xa01:1,000 dilution of Tetraspeck beads in 2Ã SSC at \\nroom temperature for 5â10 min. The density of the beads could be easily adjusted \\nby varying the dilution factor or incubation time. Then, the samples were rinsed \\nwith 2Ã SSC and incubated with degassed 4% acrylamide (1610154; Bio-Rad) \\nsolution in 2Ã SSC for 5 min at room temperature. To initiate polymerization, \\nthe 4% acrylamide solution was aspirated, then 10 Î¼l of 4% hydrogel solution con-\\ntaining 4% acrylamide (1:19), 2Ã SSC, 0.2% ammonium persulfate (APS) (A3078; \\nSigma) and 0.2% N,N,Nâ²,Nâ²-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) (T7024; \\nSigma) was dropped on the sample, and sandwiched by a coverslip functional-\\nized by GelSlick (Lonza; 50640). The polymerization step was allowed to occur at \\nroom temperature for 1 h in a home-made nitrogen gas chamber. After that, the \\ntwo coverslips were gently separated, and the excess gel was cut away with a razor. \\nA custom-made flow cell (RD478685-M; Grace Bio-Labs) was attached to the \\ncoverslips covering the region of cells embedded in hydrogel. The hydrogel- \\nembedded cell samples were cleared as previously described for >1 h at 37\\u2009Â°C19. \\nThe digestion buffer consisted of 1:100 proteinase K (P8107S; NEB), 50 mM pH \\n8 Tris HCl (AM9856; Invitrogen), 1 mM EDTA (15575020; Invitrogen), 0.5% \\nTriton-X 100 and 500 mM NaCl (S5150, Sigma). Then, the samples were rinsed \\nwith 2Ã SSC multiple times and subjected to Label-IT modification (1:10) (MIR \\n3900; Mirus Bio) at 37\\u2009Â°C for 30 min. After that, the cell samples were post-fixed \\nwith 4% PFA in 1Ã PBS to stabilize the DNA, RNA and the overall cell sample for \\n15 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by 1 M pH\\xa08.0 Tris HCl \\nat room temperature for 10 min. The cell samples were either imaged immediately \\nor kept in 4Ã SSC supplemented with 2 U\\xa0Î¼lâ1 of SUPERase In RNase inhibitor \\n(AM2696; Invitrogen) at 4\\u2009Â°C for no longer than 6 h.\\nMice. All animal care and experiments were carried out in accordance with Caltech \\nInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and NIH guidelines. \\nWild-type mice C57BL/6J of\\xa0post-natal day (P)23 (male) and P40 (male) were used \\nfor the cortex and olfactory bulb seqFISH+ experiments, respectively. For smFISH \\nLetter RESEARCH\\nexperiments, adult wild-type mice C57BL/6J aged 10 weeks (female) were used \\nfor the RNA localization experiment in the cortex and ligandâreceptor interaction \\nexperiment in the olfactory bulb. For cell cluster validation in the olfactory bulb, \\na section from P40 mice was used.\\nTissue slices experiment. Brain extraction was performed as previously described3. \\nIn brief, mice were perfused for 8 min with perfusion buffer (10 U\\xa0mlâ1 heparin, \\n0.5% NaNO2 (w/v) in 0.1 M PBS at 4\\u2009Â°C). Mice were then perfused with fresh 4% \\nPFA in 0.1 M PBS buffer at 4\\u2009Â°C for 8 min. The mouse brain was removed from \\nthe skull and immediately placed in a 4% PFA buffer for 2 h at room temperature \\nunder gentle mixing. The brain was then immersed in 4\\u2009Â°C 30% RNase-free sucrose \\n(Amresco 0335) in 1Ã PBS until the brain sank. After the brain sank, the brain was \\nfrozen in a dry iceâisopropanol bath in OCT medium and stored at â80\\u2009Â°C. Five-\\nmicrometre sections were cut using a cryotome and immediately placed on the \\nfunctionalized coverslips. The thin tissue slices were stored at â80\\u2009Â°C. To perform \\nhybridization on the tissue slices, the tissue slices were first permeabilized in 70% \\nethanol at 4\\u2009Â°C for >1 h. Then, the tissue slices were cleared with 8% SDS (AM9822; \\nInvitrogen) in 1Ã PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Primary probes were \\nhybridized to the tissue slices by spreading out the hybridization buffer solution \\nwith a coverslip. The hybridization was allowed to proceed for ~60 h at 37\\u2009Â°C. After \\nprimary probe hybridization, the tissue slices were washed with 40% formamide \\nat 37\\u2009Â°C for 30 min. After rinsing with 2Ã SSC three times and 1Ã PBS once, the \\nsample was subjected to treatment with 0.1\\xa0mg\\xa0mlâ1 Acryoloyl-X succinimidyl \\nester (A20770; Thermo Fisher) in 1Ã PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Then, \\nthe tissue slices were incubated with 4% acrylamide (1:19 crosslinking) hydrogel \\nsolution in 2Ã SSC for 30 min at room temperature. The hydrogel solution was \\naspirated and 20 Î¼l of 4% hydrogel solution containing 0.05% APS and 0.05% \\nTEMED in 2Ã SSC was dropped onto the tissue slice and sandwiched by Gel-\\nSlick functionalized slides. The samples were transferred to 4\\u2009Â°C in a home-made \\nnitrogen gas chamber for 30 min before transferring to 37\\u2009Â°C for 2.5 h to complete \\npolymerization. After polymerization, the hydrogel-embedded tissue slices were \\ncleared with digestion buffer as mentioned above, except that\\xa0it included 1% SDS, \\nfor >3 h at 37\\u2009Â°C. After digestion, the tissue slices were rinsed with 2Ã SSC multi-\\nple times and subjected to 0.1\\xa0mg\\xa0mlâ1 label-X modification19 for 45 min at 37\\u2009Â°C. \\nThe preparation of label-X stock was as previously described19. To further stabilize \\nthe DNA probes, RNA molecules, and the overall structure\\xa0of the tissue slices, the \\ntissue slices were re-embedded in hydrogel solution as in the previous step, except \\nthat\\xa0the gelation time could be shortened to 2 h. The tissue slice samples were either \\nimaged immediately or kept in 4Ã SSC supplemented with 2 U\\xa0Î¼lâ1 of SUPERase \\nIn RNase Inhibitor at 4\\u2009Â°C for no longer than 6 h.\\nseqFISH+ imaging. The imaging platform and automated fluidics delivery system \\nwere similar to those previously described9 with some modifications. In brief, \\nthe flow cell on the sample was first connected to the automated fluidics system. \\nThen the region of interest (ROI) was registered using nuclei signals stained with \\n10 Î¼g\\xa0mlâ1 DAPI (D8417; Sigma). For cell culture experiments, blank images con-\\ntaining beads only were first imaged before the first round of serial hybridization. \\nEach serial hybridization buffer contained three unique sequences with different \\nconcentrations of 15-nt readouts conjugated to either Alexa Fluor 647\\xa0(50 nM), \\nCy3B\\xa0(50 nM) or Alexa Fluor 488\\xa0(100 nM) in EC buffer (10% ethylene carbonate \\n(E26258; Sigma), 10% dextran sulfate (D4911; Sigma), 4Ã SSC and 1:100 dilution \\nof SUPERase In RNase inhibitor). The 100 Î¼l of serial hybridization buffers for \\n80 rounds of seqFISH+ imaging with a repeat for round 1 (in total 81 rounds) \\nwas pipetted into a 96-well\\xa0plate. During each serial hybridization, the automated \\nsampler moves to the well of the designated hybridization buffer and moves the \\n100 Î¼l hybridization buffer through a multichannel fluidic valve (EZ1213-820-4; \\nIDEX Health & Science) to the flow cell (requires ~25 Î¼l) using a syringe pump \\n(63133-01, Hamilton Company). The serial hybridization solution was incubated \\nfor 17 min for cell culture experiments and 20 min for tissue slice experiments at \\nroom temperature. After serial hybridization, the sample was washed with ~300 Î¼l \\nof 10% formamide wash buffer (10% formamide and 0.1% Triton X-100 in 2Ã \\nSSC) to remove excess readout probes and non-specific binding. Then, the sample \\nwas rinsed with ~200 Î¼l of 4Ã SSC supplemented with a\\xa01:1,000 dilution \\nof SUPERase In RNase Inhibitor, before\\xa0being stained with DAPI solution \\n(10 Î¼g\\xa0mlâ1 of DAPI, 4Ã SSC, and\\xa0a 1:1,000 dilution of SUPERase In RNase inhib-\\nitor) for ~15 s. Next, an anti-bleaching buffer solution made of 10% (w/v) glucose, \\n1:100 diluted catalase (Sigma C3155), 0.5 mg\\xa0mlâ1 glucose oxidase (Sigma G2133), \\n0.02 U\\xa0Î¼lâ1 SUPERase In RNase inhibitor\\xa0and 50 mM pH\\xa08 Tris-HCl in 4Ã SSC \\nwas flowed through the samples. Imaging was done with a microscope (Leica \\nDMi8) equipped with a confocal scanner unit (Yokogawa CSU-W1), a sCMOS \\ncamera (Andor Zyla 4.2 Plus), a\\xa063Ã\\xa0oil objective lens (Leica 1.40 NA) and a \\nmotorized stage (ASI MS2000). Lasers from CNI and filter sets from Semrock \\nwere used. Snapshots were acquired with 0.35-Î¼m z-steps for two z-slices per FOV \\nacross 647-nm, 561-nm, 488-nm and 405-nm fluorescent channels. After imaging, \\nstripping buffer (55% formamide and 0.1% Triton-X 100 in 2Ã SSC) was flowed \\nthrough for 1 min, followed by an incubation time of 1 min before rinsing with \\n4Ã SSC solution. In general, the 15-nt readouts were stripped off within seconds, \\nand a 2-min wash ensured the removal of any residual signal. The serial hybridi-\\nzation, imaging and signal extinguishing steps were repeated for 80 rounds. Then, \\nstaining buffer for segmentation (10 Î¼g\\xa0mlâ1 DAPI, 50\\xa0nM LNA T20-Alexa Fluor \\n647 and\\xa0a 1:100 dilution of Nissl stain (N21480; Invitrogen)) in 1Ã PBS was flowed \\nin and allowed to incubate for 30 min at room temperature before imaging. The \\nintegration of automated fluidics delivery system and imaging was controlled by \\na custom written script in Î¼Manager32.\\nsmFISH. smFISH experiments were performed as previously described8. In brief, \\n60 genes were randomly chosen from the 10,000 gene list across a broad range of \\nexpression levels. The same probe sequences were used for these 60 genes, except \\neach primary probe contained two binding sites of the readout probes. The fixed \\ncells were hybridized with the primary probes (10\\xa0nM per probe) in 40% hybridiza-\\ntion buffer (40% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate and 2Ã SSC) at 37\\u2009Â°C overnight. \\nThe sample was washed with 40% wash buffer for 30 min at 37\\u2009Â°C and subjected \\nto the same hydrogel embedding and clearing as the cell culture experiment before \\nimaging. The imaging platform was the same as the one in\\xa0the seqFISH+ experi-\\nment. A single z-slice across hundreds of cells was imaged and the sum of the gene \\ncounts per cell was analysed using a custom written Matlab script. For smFISH \\nexperiments in the tissue, the sample was hybridized with 10\\xa0nM per probe in 40% \\nhybridization buffer at 37\\u2009Â°C for >16 h. The sample was washed with 40% wash \\nbuffer for 30 min at 37\\u2009Â°C and subjected to the same hydrogel embedding and \\nclearing as the tissue experiment before imaging. As the imaging time is short, the \\nAcryoloyl-X functionalization and post-hydrogel anchoring steps were omitted. \\nFive z-slices with z-steps of 1\\xa0Î¼m were taken across multiple FOVs with the imaging \\nplatform as in the seqFISH+ experiment, except that\\xa0a 40Ã oil objective was used \\n(Leica 1.40 NA). Images were background subtracted and maximum z-projected \\nfor clearer display of RNA dots.\\nImage analysis. All image analysis was performed in Matlab. Unless a specific \\nMatlab function is referenced, custom code was used.\\nImage registration. Each round of imaging included imaging with the 405-nm channel, \\nwhich included the DAPI stain of the cell along with imaging in the 647-nm, \\n561-nm and 488-nm channels of TetraSpeck beads (T7279, Thermo Fisher) and \\nseqFISH+ probes. In addition, a pre-hybridization image was used to find all beads \\nbefore the readouts were hybridized. Bead locations were fit to a 2D Gaussian \\nfunction. An initial estimate of the transformation matrix between the DAPI image \\nfor each serial hybridization round and the beads-only image was found using \\nimregcorr (Matlab). Using this estimate transformation, the bead coordinates were \\ntransformed to each serial hybridization image, where the location of the bead was \\nagain fit to a 2D Gaussian function. A final transformation matrix between each \\nhybridization image and the beads-only image was then found by applying fitge-\\notrans (Matlab) to the sets of Gaussian fit bead locations. For the tissue samples, \\nno beads were used and registration was based on DAPI alone.\\nImage processing. Each image was deconvolved, using a bead (7\\xa0Ã\\xa07 pixels) as an \\nestimate for the point spread function. Cell segmentation was performed manually \\nusingthe ROI tool in ImageJ.\\nBarcode calling. The potential RNA signals were then found by finding local max-\\nima in the image above with a predetermined pixel threshold in the registered and \\ndeconvolved images. Dot locations were then further resolved using radialcentre.\\nm33. Once all potential points in all serial hybridizations of one fluorescent channel \\nwere obtained, they were organized by pseudocolour and barcoding round. Dots \\nwere matched to potential barcode partners in all other pseudo channels of all \\nother barcoding rounds using a 1-pixel search radius (or, for the tissue samples, a \\n1.4-pixel search radius) to find symmetric nearest neighbours. Point combinations \\nthat constructed only a single barcode were immediately matched to the on-target \\nbarcode set. For point\\xa0combinations that matched to construct multiple barcodes, \\nthe point sets were first filtered by calculating the residual spatial distance of each \\npotential barcode point set, and only the point sets giving the minimum residu-\\nals were used to match to a barcode. If multiple barcodes were still possible, the \\npoint was matched to its closest on-target barcode with a Hamming distance of \\n1. If multiple on-target barcodes were still possible, then the point was dropped \\nfrom the analysis as an ambiguous barcode. This procedure was repeated using \\neach barcoding round as a seed for barcode finding and only barcodes that were \\ncalled similarly in at least 3 out of 4 rounds were used in the analysis. The number \\nof each barcode was then counted in each of the assigned cell areas and transcript \\nnumbers were assigned on the basis of the number of on-target barcodes present \\nin the cell. Centroids for each called barcode were also recorded and assigned to \\ncells. The same procedure was repeated for 647-nm, 561-nm and 488-nm channels. \\nThe remaining unused barcodes were used as an off-target evaluation by repeating \\nthe same procedure as described.\\nData analysis. RNA-seq and RNA SPOTs. Pearsonâs R correlation was performed to \\ncompare seqFISH+ data to RNA-seq (Gene Expression Omnibus\\xa0(GEO) accession \\nnumber GSE98674), RNA SPOTs8 and smFISH measurement using Matlab or \\nPython functions.\\nLetter\\nRESEARCH\\nSpatial clustering of genes for NIH/3T3 cells. The same barcode-calling procedure \\ndescribed above was repeated without cell segmentation to remove the possibility \\nof clipping potentially interesting regions of the cell. RNA locations were coarse \\ngrained to 10\\xa0Ã\\xa010 pixels, resulting in a matrix of dimensions of the\\xa0total num-\\nber of coarse-grained pixels by the number of genes. Coarse pixels with no RNA \\nwere removed from the analysis. RNA with fewer than ten copies per FOV were \\ndropped. Genes were then correlated with Pearsonâs R correlation and hierarchical \\nclustering was performed on the resulting correlation matrix. Clusters of less than \\nten genes were dropped.\\nHierarchical clustering of brain seqFISH+ data. The 10,000 genes were divided into \\nthree approximately equal subsets (with 3,334, 3,333 and 3,333 genes, respectively) \\non the basis of the group in which genes were barcoded. Genes were normalized \\nseparately within each subset, by dividing the gene counts per cell by the total \\ncounts per cell within each subset. We then multiplied the result by the scaling \\nfactor 2,000, which is approximately the median count. Next, we selected the subset \\nof cells that were in the cortex. We computed log(1\\xa0+\\xa0normalized counts).\\nTo select genes for clustering, we first computed statistics for the following \\ncriteria for each gene: (1) number of cells with non-zero expression; (2) average \\ngene expression of all cells; (3) average expression of top 5% of cells with highest \\nexpression; (4) average of top 10% of cells with highest expression; (5) average of \\ntop 2% of cells with highest expression; and (6) average gene expression of all non-\\nzero cells. For each criterion, we selected the top 25% of genes that were ranked \\nbased on the criterion. We next obtained the union of all six gene lists, forming \\nan initial 3,877-gene set. The reasoning is that the union of genes would contain \\ngenes needed to cluster both common cell types (which would be expressed in a \\nlarge population of cells, captured by criterion 2) and rare cell types (which would \\nbe expressed in a small population, captured by criteria 3, 4 and 5). The 3,877-\\ngene expression-data matrix was next transformed by z-scoring per cell and per \\ngene. Principle component analysis (PCA) was performed and jackstraw procedure \\nwas adopted to further select the most relevant genes for clustering. Specifically, \\nthe jackstraw procedure34 permutes the expression of a small number of genes to \\nidentify significant genes (that is, genes\\xa0with significantly higher loading than\\xa0the \\npermuted case (P\\xa0<\\xa00.001)). Using the top nine components, we found a total of \\n1,916 significant genes to be used for final clustering.\\nTo this 1,916-gene matrix we applied hierarchical clustering with Ward's linkage \\nand with (1\\xa0â\\xa0Pearson correlation) as the distance measure. Using the sigClust R \\npackage35, which evaluates the significance of each branching in the dendrogram, \\nwe found significant tree splits and produced 10-cluster and 16-cluster annotations \\ncorresponding to different cluster granularity. Each split was significant according \\nto sigClust FWER corrected P\\xa0<\\xa00.05. We further performed an additional round \\nof clustering within the interneuron annotated clusters, repeated\\xa0the gene-selection \\nprocedure and replaced the broad interneuron cluster with the subclusters. All \\ntogether, we derived 13-cluster and 18-cluster annotations.\\nUnsupervised comparison with scRNA-seq data. Mouse visual cortex scRNA-seq \\ndata were obtained from ref. 25. We used the cell-type annotations from the original \\nstudy, representing 9 major, 22 fine and 49 minor cell types. For comparison, \\nwe focused on the 1,857 genes that were commonly profiled by scRNA-seq and \\nseqFISH+, and we\\xa0processed the scRNA-seq data in the same way as\\xa0for seqFISH+. \\nThe degree of similarity was evaluated by using the Pearson correlation (Extended \\nData Fig.\\xa04c).\\nSupervised mapping of cell types from scRNA-seq to seqFISH+. Cell-type mapping \\nwas performed as described14. In brief, MAST36 was used to identify differentially \\nexpressed genes across annotated cell types from the scRNA-seq dataset in ref. 25, \\nusing P\\xa0=\\xa00.005 as the cut-off. A total of 1,253 of the differentially expressed genes \\nwere also profiled by seqFISH+, and therefore were retained for cell-type map-\\nping. Then, we performed a quantile\\xa0normalization on the expression vectors of \\neach gene in both the seqFISH+ and scRNA-seq data to normalize cross-platform \\ndifferences14. Multi-class support-vector machine models were trained on the \\nscRNA-seq cell types using linear kernels, and the tuning parameter C was set\\xa0to \\n1\\xa0Ã\\xa010â5 (Extended Data Fig.\\xa04d). The cross-validation accuracy of prediction of \\nthe 22 annotated cell types was 91% with these 1,253 differentially expressed genes.\\nSpatial gene identification. In brief, we computed a spatial score per gene, as pre-\\nviously described14. Cells were divided into two sets based on the basis of each \\ngene: L1 contains cells with highest 90th percentile by expression, and L0 con-\\ntains the remaining cells. The spatial score measures whether the cells in L1 are \\nspatially adjacent to each other, and is quantified by the silhouette coefficient. \\nThe silhouette coefficient was computed using the calc_silhouette_per_gene() \\nfunction in the smfish Hmrf Python package14 (https://bitbucket.org/qzhudfci/\\nsmfishhmrf-py), setting the\\xa0dissimilarity matrix to rank-transformed Euclidean \\ndistance, examine_top\\xa0=\\xa00.1, permutation_test\\xa0=\\xa0True, and permutations\\xa0=\\xa01,000. \\nRank-transformed distance was computed with rank_transform_matrix() function \\nwith reverse\\xa0=\\xa0False, rbp_P\\xa0=\\xa00.99 where rbp_P is a rank-weighting parameter. We \\nselected all spatial genes with a\\xa0significant silhouette coefficient (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01 permu-\\ntation test). To further enrich for spatial signals within these genes, we performed \\na PCA analysis, and then the jackstraw procedure34, to arrive at a set of 988 spatial \\ngenes that were\\xa0significantly correlated to the principle components. We performed \\nHMRF analysis on the top 100, 200 and\\xa0400 of the\\xa0988 genes.\\nSpatial domain identification via HMRF procedure. HMRF is a probabilistic \\nspatial-clustering method that we developed previously to identify spatial \\ndomains on the basis of spatial relationships and gene expression per cell. We \\nconstructed a neighbourhood graph by adopting a fixed radius corresponding \\nto the top percentile of pairwise physical distances between cells, resulting in an \\naverage of five neighbours per cell. HMRF was run with the following parameters: \\ntolerance\\xa0=\\xa01\\xa0Ã\\xa010â10, k\\xa0=\\xa09, and convergence_error\\xa0=\\xa01\\xa0Ã\\xa010â8. To search for an \\noptimal value of beta, we scanned through all integer values between 2 and 100 and \\nran the HMRF model for each setting. The value that resulted in minimal change \\nof log likelihood was selected as the final beta.\\nLouvain clustering. Unless specified, all functions of pre-processing and Louvain \\nclustering were performed in Python using the package SCANPY37. We followed \\na standard procedure as suggested in the SCANPY reimplementation of Seuratâs \\ntutorial to analyse seqFISH+ data, with some modifications. For clustering all \\ncells from mouse cortex, subventricular zone (SVZ), choroid plexus and olfactory \\nbulb, we first normalized the counts per cell, then chose highly variable genes with \\n>0.4 min_dispersion\\xa0and 0.01 min_mean, with max_mean\\xa0=\\xa03. This yielded 3,509 \\ngenes. Then we took the logarithm of the data, regressed out the total count effect \\nper cell and scaled the data to unit variance. We computed the PCAs and used the \\ntop principal components to compute the neighbourhood graph, before perform-\\ning Louvain clustering. We used the rank_gene_groups function with raw data, and \\nthe top 20\\xa0enriched genes in each cluster were used to identify the clusters on the \\nbasis of marker gene annotation from scRNA-seq or DropSeq data29,38. We found \\nthat both hierarchical clustering and Louvain clustering yielded similar results \\ndespite using\\xa0different methods.\\nTo spatially map back the clusters on the raw image, we performed Louvain clus-\\ntering on cortex, SVZ and choroid plexus data, and olfactory bulb data separately. \\nGenes with max count greater than four across all cells were chosen for cortex and \\nSVZ (include choroid plexus cells) data. Next, we filtered out cells with less than \\n200 genes expressed from\\xa0the analysis. The counts were normalized per cell and \\na minimum dispersion of greater than 0 with min_mean of 0.05 was chosen to \\nfilter out the variable genes. This yielded 1,813 genes for subsequent analysis. For \\nthe olfactory bulb, genes with max count greater than two across all cells were first \\nchosen. Then the counts were normalized per cell. To obtain the highly variable \\ngenes, a threshold of min_mean\\xa0of\\xa00.05 and min_dispersion of 0.2 was chosen. \\nThis yields 1,972 genes for subsequent analysis. After choosing the highly variable \\ngenes, the data were subjected to PCA reduction, computed neighbourhood graph \\nwith top PCs, and Louvain clustering. The top 20 enrichment genes were obtained \\nusing rank_genes_groups function and the clusters were identified according to \\npublished literature. Sub-clustering of the main cluster was performed by repeating \\nthe process described above. The visualization of these clusters to two dimensions \\nusing UMAP was done with the SCANPY function. These cluster numbers were \\nmapped back to the original data to visualize the spatial heterogeneity of different \\ncell types across different parts of the tissues.\\nCalculation of the time acceleration of seqFISH+ versus seqFISH-expansion. For \\nseqFISH-expansion, we assume that to code ~20,000 genes, the coding scheme \\nuses four colours and eight rounds of hybridization (47\\xa0=\\xa016,384 genes) with \\none round of error correction. Thus, the total number of effective imaging per \\nFOV is equal to the expansion factor\\xa0Ã\\xa04\\xa0Ã\\xa08. For 60-fold expansion, this is \\n60\\xa0Ã\\xa04\\xa0Ã\\xa08\\xa0=\\xa01,920 images. For seqFISH+, we assume a coding scheme with \\nthree separate fluorescent channels, with 8,000 genes coded in each channel for a \\ntotal of 24,000 genes. Pseudocolours are used to code for 8,000 genes. For example, \\nif the number of pseudocolours is 20 per fluorescent channel, then four rounds \\nof barcoding (including one round of error correction) are needed. The effective \\nimaging per FOV is then 20\\xa0Ã\\xa04\\xa0Ã\\xa03\\xa0=\\xa0240 imagesâan eightfold acceleration com-\\npared to seqFISH-expansion. As another example, if the pseudocolour per channel \\nis ten, then five rounds of barcoding are needed to cover 8,000 genes per channel. \\nThen, there is a total of 10\\xa0Ã\\xa05\\xa0Ã\\xa03\\xa0=\\xa0150 images. However, this coding scheme \\nonly provides a 10\\xa0Ã\\xa03\\xa0= 30-fold decrease in the RNA density. If an equivalent of \\n30-fold expansion was implemented, then 30\\xa0Ã\\xa04\\xa0Ã\\xa08\\xa0=\\xa0960 images are needed \\nper FOV for an acceleration rate of 960/150\\xa0=\\xa06.4 fold.\\nBootstrap analysis. We calculated the cell-to-cell correlation matrix with the num-\\nber of genes downsampled from the 2,511 genes that expressed at least 5 copies in \\na cell. For each downsampled dataset, 100, 250, 500, 1,000, 1,500 and 2,000 genes \\nwere selected randomly. The Pearsonâs correlation coefficient of each of the cell-\\nto-cell correlation matrices was computed with the cell-to-cell correlation matrix \\nfor the 2,511-gene dataset. Five trials were simulated for each downsampled gene \\nlevel. Error bars denote standard deviation.\\nNeighbour-cell analysis. The spatial coordinates for the cell centroids were used \\nto create a nearest-neighbour network (k\\xa0=\\xa04), in which nodes represent indi-\\nvidual cells and edges are observed proximities between two cells. Edges between \\nLetter RESEARCH\\nidentical or different annotated cell types were labelled as homo- or heterotypic, \\nrespectively. To identify enriched or depleted proximities between two identical or \\ndifferent cell types, the observed number of edges between any two cell types was \\ncompared to a random permutation (n\\xa0=\\xa0100) distribution by reshuffling the cell \\nlabels. Associated P values were calculated by observing how often the simulated \\nvalues were higher or lower than the observed value for respectively enriched or \\ndepleted proximities.\\nGene expression enrichment for cell types in close proximity was calculated as \\nthe average expression for that gene in all the cells of the two cell types that were in \\nclose proximity according to the spatial network. The number of observed edges \\nbetween two cell types and\\xa0the z-scores for each gene were further used to filter and \\nidentify enriched gene expression in any combination of two proximal cell types.\\nTo determine the ligandâreceptor pairs in neighbouring cells, we extracted \\ngenes that had z-scores of 1 or higher, were expressed in at least 25% of the cells \\nin the interacting pairs, and had at least 4 instances of being neighbours. We \\nthen matched up the ligandâreceptor pairs from the literature39, as\\xa0shown in \\nSupplementary Table\\xa04. To identify statistically enriched ligandâreceptor pairs, \\nwe compared the calculated ligandâreceptor scores with that of a random permu-\\ntation (n\\xa0=\\xa01,000) distribution by reshuffling the cell labels. P\\xa0<0.05 was deemed \\nto be significant.\\nRNA localization analysis. To determine the subcellular localization patterns \\nof mRNAs in the cortex, all cells were first separated into 26-cell clusters \\n(Supplementary Table\\xa02). Within each cell class, the top 200 highly expressed \\ngenes were selected for localization analysis. In each cell, the average distance of \\nall of the transcripts for each of the 200 genes from the centre of the mass of all \\nof the transcripts for all of\\xa0the genes was calculated. This metric corresponds to \\nwhether the gene is likely to be found close to or far from the cell centre. Only \\ncells with four or more copies of that RNA were included in the calculation. The \\naverage distance from the centre for each cell was normalized by the size of the \\ncellâdetermined as the square root of the area spanned by the convex hull of all \\nthe mRNA dots in that cell. To select the genes that were localized far from the \\ncentre of the cell, a threshold of 0.45 for the localization score was used and the \\naverage expression level was set at greater than 2.5 copies detected per cell. We \\nselected genes that were close to the cell centre using a localization score of 0.35 \\nor lower and an expression level of greater than 2.5 copies per cell. The results are \\nshown in Supplementary Table\\xa03.\\nContact maps. The minimum distances between the pixels defining the edge of all \\npairs of cells in a FOV were tabulated. To count the number of times cells of each \\ntype were in contact with cells of each other type, the following procedure was \\nfollowed. Cells within 15 pixels of a given cell were considered\\xa0as being in contact, \\nand the appropriate entry in a square matrix of length equal to the number of cell \\ntypes was incremented. The counts were then normalized such that each row sums \\nto 1. Hierarchical clustering was then performed to cluster cell types.\\nStep-by-step protocol.
